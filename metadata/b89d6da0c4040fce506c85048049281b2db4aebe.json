It drew some of the harshest criticism of Bowie's career, condemned by critics as a faceless piece of product and ignored by the public ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bowie himself said that the album featured good songwriting that was ruined by overly commercial and dull production. However, it featured more of Bowie's own compositions than its predecessor, Tonight.\nIn 1995,Virgin Records rereleased the album on CD with three bonus tracks,thats what we have here.\n\n\n&quot;Day-In Day-Out&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:35 \n&quot;Time Will Crawl&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18 \n&quot;Beat of Your Drum&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03 \n&quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03 \n&quot;Zeroes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:44 \n&quot;Glass Spider&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:30 \n&quot;Shining Star (Makin' My Love)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:04 \n&quot;New York's in Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32 \n&quot;'87 and Cry&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18 \n&quot;Too Dizzy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58 \n&quot;Bang Bang&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n&quot;Girls&quot; (extended edit) (1987 B-side of &quot;Time Will Crawl&quot; single) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:38 \n&quot;Julie&quot; (1987 B-side of &quot;Day-In Day-Out&quot; single) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45 \n&quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; (from the When the Wind Blows soundtrack 1985) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36  \n\nReleased April 27, 1987 \nRecorded Mountain Studios, Montreux, Switzerland 1987 \nGenre Rock, Pop rock \nLength 53:07 \nLabel EMI America Records \nProducer David Bowie and David Richards \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b89d6da0c4040fce506c85048049281b2db4aebe","amp;dn":"David+Bowie+-+Never+Let+Me+Down+%5B1987%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b89d6da0c4040fce506c85048049281b2db4aebe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,157,109,160,196,4,15,206,80,108,133,4,128,73,40,27,45,180,174,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
