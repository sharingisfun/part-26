Taking influences from KRS-One, Skinny Puppy, and Photek, and raised on a steady diet of hip-hop and early jungle records, Enduser creates industrial strength drum and bass and hip-hop flavored breakcore.\n\nWith the help of radio play from John Peel and the Breezeblock on Radio 1, a string of great reviews, and the backing of some of the top names in the hardcore and drum n bass worlds, Standafer's musical juggernaut has landed spots working with artists like The Bug, Panacea, Dr. Israel, Bill Laswell, NYC hardcore band Terror, and countless others. His recorded output has released on respected cult labels such as Hymen, Sublight, Mirex and Ad Noiseam. In addition to Enduser's output, Standafer also operates his own experimental drum and bass label, Sonicterror Recordings. (discogs.com)\n\n- - -\n\nEnduser - Left 2008\n(Ohm Resistance)\n\n 1.
