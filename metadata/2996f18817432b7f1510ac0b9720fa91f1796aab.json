He gains their trust. He kills them.\n\nThat's all Maeve Kerrigan knows about the man she is hunting. Two women were strangled in their homes, and with no sign of a break-in, there's no clue as to who might be responsible. Until there's a third murder, and the finger is pointed at DCI Josh Derwent, Maeve's colleague.\n\nIt isn't the first time Derwent has been a suspect in a murder case, and these deaths bear an unsettling similarity to the last one he was accused of. Maeve refuses to believe he could be involved, but the secrets of his past begin to unravel. How well does she really know him?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2996f18817432b7f1510ac0b9720fa91f1796aab","amp;dn":"Maeve+Kerrigan+04_+The+Stranger+You+Know+-+Jane+Casey.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2996f18817432b7f1510ac0b9720fa91f1796aab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,150,241,136,23,67,43,127,21,16,172,11,151,32,250,145,241,121,106,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
