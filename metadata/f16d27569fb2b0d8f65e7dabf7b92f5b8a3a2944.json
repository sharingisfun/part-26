Like many of the founders of that movement, he was far too political (liberal/left) to be allowed media opportunities for superstardom. Nonetheless, he made his presence felt through the decades. In the 1970s, he led a successful crusade to clean up New York's Hudson River, which was so polluted that there was not a single mile on its course that was safe to swim in. This documentary captures him in action during this time, which was also a heyday for protests against the Vietnam War. It shows him at home with his family, battling for the Hudson river, and participating in protest demonstrations, among other things. The film also includes his performances of songs that he either wrote or rediscovered and that were made famous by other singers, including &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone,&quot; and &quot;Turn, Turn, Turn.&quot;\n\n85 mins.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f16d27569fb2b0d8f65e7dabf7b92f5b8a3a2944","amp;dn":"Pete+Seeger+%281972%29+-+A+Song+And+A+Stone+%5BRare+Documentary%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f16d27569fb2b0d8f65e7dabf7b92f5b8a3a2944","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,109,39,86,159,178,176,216,246,94,125,171,247,185,47,91,138,58,41,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
