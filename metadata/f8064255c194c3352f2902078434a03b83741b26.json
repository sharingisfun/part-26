This is the RIFFTRAX version of the film. The commentary cannot be turned off.\nIf you&amp;#039;re looking for the normal version of the film, look elsewhere.\n\n!! Riffing this time are Mike Nelson and Kevin Murphy\n\n!! Video quality isn&amp;#039;t great, but good enough for a Rifftrax ;)\n\n!! All 3 Star Trek Rifftrax are now available as torrents\n\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/donate.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/donate.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis torrent was created to simplify the confusing Rifftrax syncing process. Having the riff and the film all in one AVI file or DVD is a million times more enjoyable than trying to sync everything together. Plus Disembaudio is annoying.\n\nThe makers of the original movie I don&amp;#039;t give a Spock about, but the Rifftrax crew  need your $ to keep making these!\n\nRIFFS ONLY COST $4!!! PLEASE DONATE IF YOU ENJOY THIS RIFFTRAX!!!\n\nThanks,\nAnna\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/donate.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/donate.php&lt;/a&gt;\t\t\n\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n\n720x480\nXVID AVI\n1:46:29\n751 MB\n\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n\nWhat, you need a description of this epic bomb? Okay. Three senior citizens have some madcap adventures with Saddam Hussein, Uhura does a naked fan dance, and God tries to hitch a ride but gets blasted by Klingons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8064255c194c3352f2902078434a03b83741b26","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+V+Rifftrax+%28AVI%29+a.k.a.+Star+Trek+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8064255c194c3352f2902078434a03b83741b26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,6,66,85,193,148,195,53,47,41,2,7,132,52,160,59,131,116,27,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
