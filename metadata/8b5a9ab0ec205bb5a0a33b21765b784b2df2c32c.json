Kundu and  Ira M. Cohen\nReview\nDirect-write technologies, the latest advance in fabricating electronic and sensor devices and power sources, refer to techniques/processes capable of depositing, dispensing, or processing diverse types of materials (including biological) over surfaces following a preset pattern/layout. The editors, with the Materials Science and Technology Division at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC, introduce these commercially valuable methods for generating high-quality patterns capable of producing working prototypes so rapidly that they represent a paradigm shift. The 18 contributed chapters cover applications; materials for implementing applications; dispensing type approaches to direct writing (e.g., ink jet technology, dip-pen nanolithography); comparison with other approaches to pattern and material transfer; and current and future trends. Includes illustrations, appended material on ancillary technologies, and 265 references.Book News, Inc.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Portland, OR\nBook Description\nA basic but comprehensive introductory text on the fundamentals of fluid mechanics and applications in engineering and science. \nProduct Details\nHardcover: 700 pages\nPublisher: Academic Press; 2 edition (August 17, 2001)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0121782514\nISBN-13: 978-0121782511\n\n[poly-technic.blogspot]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b5a9ab0ec205bb5a0a33b21765b784b2df2c32c","amp;dn":"Fluid+Mechanics%2C+2nd+Edition+by++Pijush+K.+Kundu+and++Ira+M.+Coh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b5a9ab0ec205bb5a0a33b21765b784b2df2c32c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,90,154,176,236,32,91,181,160,163,59,33,118,91,120,75,45,242,195,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
