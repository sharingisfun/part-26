The story of their experiences after leaving Poland is narrated--in Yiddish--by Szlingerbaum's mother in voice-over. In the first part of the film, the mother relates her experiences traveling by train from Lodz, Poland to Paris and finally to Brussels. On the screen, we see film clips of trains and train stations in modern-day Brussels.\n\nIn the second part of the film, Szlingerbaum's mother relates her experiences as a young wife and mother in an alien city. No one we see is actively cruel to her, but there's a tremendous sense of loneliness and alienation in her narrative. During the narration, actors portray the action as told to us by Szlingerbaum's mother. The scenes unfold in a static, almost dreamlike fashion. The photography is in black and white, and the actors are always seen in middle distance.\n\n-----\n\nGeneral\nContainer:  \tAVI\nRuntime: \t1h 16mn\nSize: \t908 MiB\nVideo\nCodec: \tXviD\nResolution: \t528x400 \nAspect ratio:  \t4:3\nFrame rate: \t25.000 fps\nBit rate: \t1 459 Kbps\nBPP: \t0.276\nAudio\n#1:  \t 2.0ch MP3 @ 192 Kbps\n\n-------\n\nYIDDISH AND FRENCH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES (.srt)\n\n------\n\n[[[THANKS TO KG]]]\n\n------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.intemporel.com/images/produit/images/45613.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.intemporel.com/images/produit/images/45613.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img402.imageshack.us/img402/3654/84692534.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img402.imageshack.us/img402/3654/84692534.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img341.imageshack.us/img341/689/34585422.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img341.imageshack.us/img341/689/34585422.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/2842/41265019.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/2842/41265019.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/2766/22650929.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/2766/22650929.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/489/62184169.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/489/62184169.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51b95a92940e61563c84496390d175eb729681b9","amp;dn":"Bruxelles-Transit+%28Samy+Szlingerbaum%2C+1982%29+DVDRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51b95a92940e61563c84496390d175eb729681b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,185,90,146,148,14,97,86,60,132,73,99,144,209,117,235,114,150,129,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
