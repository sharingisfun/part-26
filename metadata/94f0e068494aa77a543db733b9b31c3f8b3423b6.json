What, for instance, can be more complicated, more logical, more marvellous than a language? Yet whence can this admirably organised production have arisen, except it be the outcome of the unconscious genius of crowds? The most learned academics, the most esteemed grammarians can do no more than note down the laws that govern languages; they would be utterly incapable of creating them. Even with respect to the ideas of great men are we certain that they are exclusively the offspring of their brains? No doubt such ideas are always created by solitary minds, but is it not the genius of crowds that has furnished the thousands of grains of dust forming the soil in which they have sprung up?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94f0e068494aa77a543db733b9b31c3f8b3423b6","amp;dn":"The+Crowd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94f0e068494aa77a543db733b9b31c3f8b3423b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,240,224,104,73,74,167,122,84,61,183,51,185,179,28,63,139,52,35,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
