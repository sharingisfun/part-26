Two days later, the Expeditionary force arrived to relieve Gordon, but found the town firmly in the hands of the Mahdi. In EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pride, Julian Symons tells the story of the disastrous and tragic failure of this mission. Analyzing events from both a political and military stance, and consulting a wide range of sources, he questions why the Gladstone government did not act sooner in the first place, and once orders were given, what contributed to the complex chain of events that was ultimately to thwart the relieving force. Capturing in brilliant detail all the glory of Victorian times, EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pride is a vivid and dramatic book on a sorely neglected subject","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1daedf691dc972e177818a6636b005c5180b9d19","amp;dn":"England%27s+Pride-+The+Story+of+the+Gordon+Relief+Expedition+by+Ju","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1daedf691dc972e177818a6636b005c5180b9d19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,174,223,105,29,201,114,225,119,129,138,102,54,176,5,197,24,11,157,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
