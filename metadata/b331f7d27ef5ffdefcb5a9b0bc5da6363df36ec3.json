This book represents the first substantive study of state-run activities in this field. It shows that all biological warfare programs have included a component concerned with the development of anti-crop agents and munitions. Current concern over the proliferation of biological weapons is placed in the context of the initiative to strengthen the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. The author concludes that the risks posed by this form of warfare can be minimized by implementation of regimes concerning the peaceful use and control of plant pathogens that pose a risk to human health and the environment.\n\n\nHardcover: 288 pages\nPublisher: Palgrave Macmillan (January 12, 2002)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0333920856\nISBN-13: 978-0333920855\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Biological-Warfare-Against-Palgrave-MacMillan/dp/0333920856/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372647742&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Biological+Warfare+Against+Crops&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Biological-Warfare-Against-Palgrave-MacMillan/dp/0333920856/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372647742&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Biological+Warfare+Against+Crops&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b331f7d27ef5ffdefcb5a9b0bc5da6363df36ec3","amp;dn":"Biological+Warfare+Against+Crops+%5Bblackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b331f7d27ef5ffdefcb5a9b0bc5da6363df36ec3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,49,247,210,126,245,255,222,252,181,169,176,188,93,166,54,61,243,110,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
