It's a secret unlocked from outer space with a breathtaking new technology. Sensors mounted in satellites and on spacecraft can see what the human eye cannot. Ancient cities hidden under jungle canopies, entire civilizations buried under great dunes of desert sand: this is sky archaeology.\n\n\n\n\nNARRATED BY:  Dave Gilbert\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Sky Archaeology \nYear:  2007\nFile Size: 746 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:52:00\nVideo Codec: DivX5\nVideo Resolution: 624x464\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1958 kbit/s\nFPS:  29.970000\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: (AC3) MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2 (Dual Eng/Ch. audio)\nSubtitles: (External English)\n\n\n \n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\nNote: External English subtitle included.\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE: I have reached the totaly ammount of bandwidth at my regular image \n-------------\n              site.
