Week by week, individuals will be eliminated until each celebrity has only one person on their team left to compete for the title of &quot;The Voice of America,&quot; in a live finale. Unlike American Idols' lengthy audition process, the celebrity mentors will select their team members via a blind audition, so they'll only be able to hear their voices. The show will have three stages of competition-the blind audition, a battle phase, and the live performance shows. Viewers will take part in the show by casting votes to help determine the finalists, who are competing for the grand prizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œa recording contract.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9beb5b28a5d411304b1dd27e2731590246db560","amp;dn":"The.Voice.S05E01.HDTV.x264-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9beb5b28a5d411304b1dd27e2731590246db560","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,190,181,178,138,93,65,19,4,177,221,39,226,115,21,144,36,109,181,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
