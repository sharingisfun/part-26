As you probably know, the DVD's of season two of The Fugitive were released with a completely new, synthesized music score which destroyed much of the show's drama. Now, thanks to the Fugitive Audio Restoration Team, you can enjoy the show in top quality as it was originally intended to be experienced.\n\nAlso included in this torrent is the introduction of this episode by none other than Barry Morse, who played Lt. Philip Gerard for four seasons of The Fugitive.\n\nThe Fugitive Season 2 (1964)\nS02E09 Escape Into Black\nFirst aired: 11/17/1964\n\nOn the verge of closing in on the shadowy one-armed man, Kimble is rendered amnesiac after a freak gas explosion at a roadside diner. While the fugitive fights to regain his memory, a struggle ensues at the hospital between Margaret Ruskin, a social worker who recognizes Kimble and believes him to be innocent, and a local physician, Dr. Towne, who believes Kimble to be guilty. Meanwhile, the one-armed man slips away, but not before he makes an anonymous phone call to the police and Gerard about Kimble's whereabouts.\n\nCast: David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble, Barry Morse as Lt. Philip Gerard\n\nGuest cast: Betty Garrett (Margaret Ruskin), Ivan Dixon (Dr. Towne), Bill Raisch (Fred Johnson, the One-Armed Man)\n\n(synopsis by jeans2nd)\n\nRead more about the replacement of the original music of this series:\nhttp://www.filmmusicsociety.org/news_events/features/2008/081508.html\n\nFile:  The Fugitive S02E09 Escape Into Black - Barry Morse Introduction.avi\nTotal Streams:  2\nRunning Time:  0:02:50\nIndex Chunk:  Yes\nInterleaved:  Yes\nMax Bytes Per Sec:  0\nAUDIO: 0 - MP3 (0x55)     \nAverage Bitrate Per Sec:  160 kb/s     \nSamples Rate:  48000 Hz     \nChannels:  2     \nBits Per Sample:  0     \nSuggestedBufferSize:  1000     \nSample Size:  1     \nVariable Bitrate:  No\nVIDEO:  DX50     \nB-VOP: No     \nS(GMC)-VOP: No     \nQuarterPixel: No     \nFrame Size:  512 x 384     \nFrames Rate:  29.970     \nColor Depth:  24     \nTotal Frames:  5115     \nSuggestedBufferSize:  21722\n\n\nFile:  The Fugitive S02E09 Escape Into Black OST Restored.avi\nTotal Streams:  2\nRunning Time:  0:51:37\nIndex Chunk:  Yes\nInterleaved:  Yes\nMax Bytes Per Sec:  0\nAUDIO: 0 - MP3 (0x55)     \nAverage Bitrate Per Sec:  160 kb/s     \nSamples Rate:  48000 Hz     \nChannels:  2     \nBits Per Sample:  0     \nSuggestedBufferSize:  10080     \nSample Size:  480     Variable Bitrate:  No\nVIDEO:  DX50     \nB-VOP: Yes     \nS(GMC)-VOP: No     \nQuarterPixel: No     \nFrame Size:  512 x 384     \nFrames Rate:  23.976     \nColor Depth:  24     \nTotal Frames:  74254     \nSuggestedBufferSize:  61171\n\n***Don't forget your Thank-You's. ***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:349c0cfb6136d121143ab27463096d690a87a2ac","amp;dn":"The+Fugitive+S02E09+F.A.R.T.+1964+Version+Escape+Into+Black+with","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"349c0cfb6136d121143ab27463096d690a87a2ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,156,12,251,97,54,209,33,20,58,178,116,99,9,109,105,10,135,162,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
