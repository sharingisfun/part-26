Both &quot;Life in Tokyo&quot;, a collaboration with renowned disco producer Giorgio Moroder, and &quot;European Son&quot; were remixed and re-issued twice.\n\nAssemblage was the first of numerous Japan compilations issued by Hansa Records/BMG Ariola/Sony BMG Music Entertainment but remains the only one originally released in consultation with the band members themselves. Coincidentally, the titles of six of the ten songs refer to geographical places (namely statelines, Communist China, Rhodesia, Berlin, Tokyo, and Europe).\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Japan-Assemblage/release/379053&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Japan-Assemblage/release/379053&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFLAC format\nHansa Ã¢â‚¬Å½Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 254 067\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b994538af4479ee53430b29a337a6eb7aa17fe1","amp;dn":"JAPAN+-+Assemblage+%281981%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b994538af4479ee53430b29a337a6eb7aa17fe1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,153,69,56,175,68,121,238,83,67,11,41,163,55,166,235,122,161,127,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
