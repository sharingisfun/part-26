In this extraordinary book Julia Blackburn follows Goya through the remaining thirty-five years of his life. It was a time of political turmoil, of war, violence and confusion, and Goya transformed what he saw happening in the world around him into his visionary paintings, drawings and etchings. These were also years of tenderness for Goya, of intimate relationships with the Duchess of Alba and with Leocadia, his mistress, who was with him to the end.Julia Blackburn writes of the elderly painter with the intimacy of an old friend, seeing through his eyes and sharing the silence in his head. Goya never stopped working, producing paintings 'between two cigarettes', and Blackburn captures his ferocious energy, his passion and his genius","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdcbe57bd5e03b55290e4bc18b7091195086339d","amp;dn":"Old+Man+Goya+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdcbe57bd5e03b55290e4bc18b7091195086339d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,203,229,123,213,224,59,85,41,14,75,193,139,112,145,25,80,134,51,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
