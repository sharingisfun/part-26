I think the most time we've had off is about six weeks in the last 12 years, so we're due a break.&quot; In another NME interview, Matt said that he was thinking about writing a more personal music project for their next album. &quot;I sense that that's going to lead to a writing project that will be more personal, rather than talking about grand political concerns. That itself might lead to material that's more suitable for smaller venues.&quot;\n\nChris has said in a recent interview that the band want to do something &quot;radically different&quot; on their next album. The bassist told Kerrang! magazine that it felt like they were &quot;drawing a line&quot; under their past and were eager to embrace new ideas. He said:&quot; feel like we are drawing a line under a certain period of what we've done in our career. It feels like it's time to move on and do something radically different.&quot; However, he also admitted that it wasn't always easy to progress and push their sound forward, adding: &quot;But then you could get into the studio and go back to what you're comfortable with. You get in the studio and there's a natural process and you have to see where a song will take you.&quot;\n\nOn his Twitter account Matt jokingly described the album as a &quot;christian gangsta rap jazz odyssey, with some ambient rebellious dubstep and face melting metal flamenco cowboy psychedelia&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.musewiki.org/The_2nd_Law_(album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.musewiki.org/The_2nd_Law_(album)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f7e6faceaeabbc6b185a83ca821e47f2841bf4b","amp;dn":"MUSE+-+2012+-+The+2nd+Law+-+mp3+-+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f7e6faceaeabbc6b185a83ca821e47f2841bf4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,126,111,172,234,234,187,198,177,133,168,60,168,33,228,127,40,65,191,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
