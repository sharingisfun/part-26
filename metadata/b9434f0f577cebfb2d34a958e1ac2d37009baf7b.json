About Ultima Edition\n---------------\n\n\tUltima Edition of Arcanum was created in the spring break of 2008 when my Girlfriend wanted a copy of Arcanum. This edition has the No-CD Crack installed and has Extra material that you may want such as extra Modules and The Character Editor. Also Included in this edition is a small guide the Manual for the game and Module Editor. \n\tThere was a few idiotic moments when making this....One was the Bordum the other was the fact that I wasn&amp;#039;t going to make it public...But Hey what can I say, I download alot so I decided to give in return. \n\n\n2. How to START ARCANUM\n-----------------------\n\nThere are two ways to start Arcanum\n\tA. Play from the Game Disc. Thats right this game has been modified for Gameplay of \t   the disc. Kinda of Idiotic I know, But who the fuck cares? You can play it \t   anywhere BITCH\n\tB. Use the custom Setup.exe and Install it on harddrive and play it on your PC like \t   normal, that was my Girlfriends Idea.\n\n\n3. The Bonus Material\n-----------------------\n\t*Offical Trokia Maps (Intergrated)\n\t*Max level 126 (Intergrated)\n\t*Map (Found on the CD)\n\t*Character Editor (Found in the CD under /Extra)\n\t*Alot of portraits (HOLY SHIT!!!
