Developing the new time theory enabled controlling its existing form. The world has changed thanks to that! Machines which slow down the time are a permanent element of the human life.\n\nIn 2026, just after establishing the EIA (Earth Interplanetary Alliance) and determining the space law, people started to make regular trips into space. Thanks to the minerals obtained during the explorations of other planets, the technological development continues to pick up pace.\n15 years later, at the beginning of 2036 after intercepting an unusual signal from an unknown civilization, the EIA Ministry assigned all its financial and logistic resources in order to make another contact..\n\nUnfortunately, the Xelorians turned out to be uninterested in the diplomatic contact with humans and the only activity which they were willing to take towards human beings was to begin military action.\n\nWhat's in this version: (Updated : Sep 5, 2012)\n\n    Bug fixes\n    New two ships to control by player\n    Details level selection\n    Lower memory consumption\n    Episode III Announced - Coming soon\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.1+\n\n\n                                   By bobiras2009\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e61688359955eb56357c0459d10f23d08d2619b","amp;dn":"Xelorians+-+Space+Shooter+v1.2.3+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e61688359955eb56357c0459d10f23d08d2619b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,97,104,131,89,149,94,181,99,87,192,69,157,16,242,61,8,210,97,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
