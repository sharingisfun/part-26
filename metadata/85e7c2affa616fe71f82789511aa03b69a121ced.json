The scene concludes with Cagney doing what Cagney does best - taking on two guys with both fists.\n\nA huge box office success and a key film in James Cagney's rise to stardom, this drama stars Cagney as Matt Nolan, a gritty New York City cab driver who is being squeezed by a monopolistic taxi trust which uses force to run him and other independent cabbies away from the most profitable locations.  Nolan joins forces with Pop Riley (Guy Kibbee), whose cab is smashed by a truck when he refuses to cooperate with the syndicate.\n\nNolan is dating Riley's daughter Sue (Loretta Young), and they eventually marry, although the marriage is rocky from the start.  Right after the marriage, Cagney sets out to avenge his brother's  murder, which was committed by the head racketeer of the taxi corporation.\n\nTVRip&gt;DivX/No Subs/NTSC/b&amp;w/640x480/1309kbps/23.976fps/mp3/48KHz/stereo/103Kbps/69min/700Mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85e7c2affa616fe71f82789511aa03b69a121ced","amp;dn":"Taxi+%281932%29+James+Cagney++TVRip%3EDVR%3EDivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85e7c2affa616fe71f82789511aa03b69a121ced","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,231,194,175,250,97,111,231,31,130,120,149,17,170,3,182,154,18,28,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
