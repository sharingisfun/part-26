Synthesisers. Glacial melancholy. Sweden. The Sound Of Arrows tick as many boxes as your average clothing chain marketing meeting, but nobody outside the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ27 clubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ever died from being obvious. The chafe between blubbing and binary code just works. And so this album is the finest addition to the canon since Hurts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even Swedish. Better still, Ã¢â‚¬ËœVoyageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is just that in the finest of senses, gliding you through its phases in metallic pastel shades from romantic euphoria (Ã¢â‚¬ËœMagicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), the crush of heartbreak (Ã¢â‚¬ËœHurting All The WayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) through to an epic closer called Ã¢â‚¬ËœThere Is Still HopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. This is basically what Coldplay were shooting for.&quot; \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d7a53ba0a13a6850e8452d55ba87368098811ed","amp;dn":"The+Sound+Of+Arrows+-+Voyage+%28Bonus+Disk+Version%29+%5B2011%5D+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d7a53ba0a13a6850e8452d55ba87368098811ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,122,83,186,10,19,166,133,14,132,82,213,91,168,115,104,9,136,17,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
