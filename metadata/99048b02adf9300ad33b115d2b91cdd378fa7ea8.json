I remember sitting once with my Choir Minister. I have Dissociative Amnesia. I can remember sometimes just a bit out of a situation. I can usually see a small excerpt of what happened in great detail. But usually just a small scene. When I was 14 my best friend died. I know that I intentional set my memories aside. I thought I had to protect him, even in Heaven...that I had to protect even God.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99048b02adf9300ad33b115d2b91cdd378fa7ea8","amp;dn":"Susan+Boyle.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99048b02adf9300ad33b115d2b91cdd378fa7ea8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,4,139,2,173,249,48,10,211,59,17,93,43,145,205,211,120,250,126,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
