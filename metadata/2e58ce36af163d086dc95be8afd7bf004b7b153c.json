Cameras follow Hugh's personal journey as he discovers a new and authentic interpretation of some of the great songs which have shaped generations of musicians and defined so much of American culture. Taking a close look at the city of New Orleans, the film captures behind the scenes moments as Hugh prepares to record his own versions of blues and jazz songs. There is also a special concert in Latrobes in the city's French Quarter, where for one night only Hugh and his band perform alongside contemporary legends like Allen Toussaint, Tom Jones and Irma Thomas.\n\nITV Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.itv.com/perspectives/documentaries/hugh-laurie-down-by-the-river/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.itv.com/perspectives/documentaries/hugh-laurie-down-by-the-river/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nSource: HDTV\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 46mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.37 GB\nSubtitles: merged\n\nXvid and SRT available at MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e58ce36af163d086dc95be8afd7bf004b7b153c","amp;dn":"ITV+Perspectives+Down+by+the+River+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e58ce36af163d086dc95be8afd7bf004b7b153c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,88,206,54,175,22,61,8,109,201,91,232,175,215,191,0,75,123,21,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
