Composing with innovative minimalism for films as \nmemorable as &quot;The Draughtsman's Contract&quot;, &quot;The Ogre&quot;, &quot;Man on \nWire&quot;, and most famously for Campion's &quot;The Piano&quot;, he has reached \nan international audience. But now, Michael Nyman is about to \nbecome a filmmaker himself. Featuring unprecedented access to the \ncomposer and his working life, this film shows one of the great \ncomposers of our time in all his diversity and endless energy. From \nLondon to Berlin, in Mexico, Poland, the Netherlands and Portugal the \nfilm is also a journey through the musical world today. It shows \nMichael Nyman, the musician, in his concerts with The Michael Nyman \nBand and live collaborations with other internationally known \nmusicians or orchestras. But throughout his journeys, this film \ndiscovers Nyman's increasing passion for filming and photography.\n\n\n\n\nLets not forget Gattaca - great soundtrack or best soundtrack?\n\n\nEnjoy this quality doco!\n\n\n\n__ W4F is looking for __\n. 100mbit+ affil sites (archives a plus)\n.
