A must see for serious fans of musical theatre. Reviews below from the PBS website and from Amazon.\n\nRambam1776\n\n\nThe biggest hit to land on Broadway in years -- taking home a record-breaking 12 Tony Awards this past spring -- is &quot;The Producers,&quot; Mel Brooks&amp;#039; stage adaptation of his 1968 Oscar-winning movie classic. In addition to cowriting the book for the Broadway incarnation of his madcap tale -- which follows a desperate producer and mild-mannered accountant&amp;#039;s attempt to make a fortune by producing a surefire bomb -- Brooks composed the music and lyrics for 16 new songs. Now GREAT PERFORMANCES goes behind the scenes as Brooks brings his personal antics to the all-day original cast album recording session with Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, and Tony-winning director Susan Stroman, featuring performances of 10 songs from his delightfully expanded score.\n\nA timeline of some of the key events on the production&amp;#039;s road from movie to theater phenomenon are featured in the Multimedia Presentation: &quot;The Producers&quot; Scrapbook. In Dialogue, watch interviews with three of the show&amp;#039;s stars: Cady Huffman (Ulla), Gary Beach (Roger de Bris), and Brad Oscar (Franz Liebkind).

Recording &quot;The Producers&quot;: A Musical Romp with Mel Brooks follows creator Brooks, stars Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, and the rest of the company as they create the cast recording for the musical that won a record 12 Tony Awards and became the hottest ticket on Broadway in the spring of 2001. Brooks provides plot background and historical anecdotes between the 14 musical numbers that are excerpted, including &quot;The King of Broadway,&quot; &quot;I Wanna Be a Producer,&quot; &quot;When You Got It, Flaunt It,&quot; and the inevitable &quot;Springtime for Hitler.&quot; Watching this 85-minute documentary is no substitute for seeing the live show (or the 1968 film that inspired it), but it&amp;#039;s an enlightening and entertaining companion to the CD. --David Horiuchi \n\nProduct Description\nThe exuberant atmosphere of the Broadway blockbuster is captured in &quot;Recording The Producers: A Musical Romp with Mel Brooks,&quot; a new 85-minute film from the Emmy Award-winning director Susan Froemke and Maysles Films. The documentary candidly captures the excitement of translating the show into a complete experience for the recording&amp;#039;s audience. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Recording-Producers-Musical-Romp-Brooks/dp/B00005OCJO&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Recording-Producers-Musical-Romp-Brooks/dp/B00005OCJO&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308800/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308800/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EakcgaaBC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EakcgaaBC&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50731ccec7952151f0d4fcd8755224fde76a0890","amp;dn":"Recording+the+Producers+-+Mel+Brooks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50731ccec7952151f0d4fcd8755224fde76a0890","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,115,28,206,199,149,33,81,240,212,252,216,117,82,36,253,231,106,8,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
