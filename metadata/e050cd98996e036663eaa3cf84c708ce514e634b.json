The group is notable for having started the careers of three of rock's most famous guitarists: Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page, all of whom were in the top fifteen of Rolling Stone's 100 Top Guitarists list (Clapton as #4, Page as #9, and Beck as #14). A blues-based band that broadened its range into pop and rock, The Yardbirds were pioneers in guitar innovations of the '60s: fuzz tone, feedback, distortion, backwards echo, improved amplification, etc. Pat Pemberton, writing for Spinner, holds that the Yardbirds were &quot;the most impressive guitar band in rock music&quot;. After the Yardbirds broke up in 1968, their current lead guitarist Jimmy Page founded what became Led Zeppelin. The bulk of the band's most successful self-written songs came from bassist/producer Paul Samwell-Smith who, with singer/harmonica player Keith Relf, drummer Jim McCarty and rhythm guitarist/bassist Chris Dreja, constituted the core of the group. The band reformed in the 1990s, featuring McCarty, Dreja and new members. The Yardbirds were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.\n\n.: Yardbirds Groups :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img257.imageshack.us/img257/7773/y1xc5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img257.imageshack.us/img257/7773/y1xc5.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\n1964 - Five Live Yardbirds\n1964 - The Yardbirds_Live!
