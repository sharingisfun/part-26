It is implied that the title of the manga is derived from the &quot;good endings&quot; that are achieved in harem visual novels. Although the story was once concluded in the one shot version, the full version includes identical characters and settings.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3512845eec86dc5e4b4ec44f1fd34f849965bad4","amp;dn":"GE%3A+Good+Ending+-+Vol.+11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3512845eec86dc5e4b4ec44f1fd34f849965bad4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,18,132,94,236,134,220,94,75,78,196,79,31,211,79,132,153,101,186,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
