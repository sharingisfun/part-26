They cross too many boxes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they\\\\\\'re shamelessly radio-friendly and insanely melodic, they have a \\\\\\'wacky\\\\\\' name and theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re simply too popular/ist to garner much of a credible critical vote. On the contrary, that scraping sound you can hear is the widespread music media dragging their shovels towards This Modern Glitch intending to bury ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ largely unheard and with extreme prejudice ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the leading exponents of what the trolls have deemed \\\\\\&quot;landfill indie\\\\\\&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f12ed965b1952646e8f6c1a9bebf2201e00d7976","amp;dn":"The+Wombats+Proudly+Present%3A+This+Modern+Glitch+%28FULL+ALBUM%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f12ed965b1952646e8f6c1a9bebf2201e00d7976","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,46,217,101,177,149,38,70,232,246,193,169,190,191,34,1,224,13,121,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
