Johnston\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\n\nOtherwise rational people believe - or at least partially believe - in many fantastical myths about the world in which they live. Indeed, it is an entirely human inclination to want to believe in what might be called otherworldly explanations for phenomena for which there are no easily explainable causes.\n\nIn these eye-opening lectures, Professor Susan A. Johnston applies an archaeological perspective to the biggest myths and mysteries in world history. Examining prominent theories and available evidence in a scholarly light, Professor Johnston introduces her audience to the scientific method, demonstrating the most reasonable course for determining whether one's beliefs have merit, or are perhaps less than satisfying when held up to more rigorous examination.\n\nSusan A. Johnston is a part-time faculty member in anthropology at the George Washington University in Washington, D.C. She teaches a variety of courses in anthropology and archaeology, including the archaeology of the Celtic peoples, archaeological myths and mysteries, and the anthropology of religion. Professor Johnston has carried out archaeological research in Ireland since the 1980s, when she did her Ph.D. dissertation on Irish rock art of the Neolithic and Bronze Age. She has also done archaeological work in such varied places as India, England, and Rhode Island.\n\n14 Lectures\n35 minutes/lecture\n\n1 How Do We Know Things?\n2 Science and How It Works\n3 Archaeology\n4 The Discovery of America\n5 All Things Egyptian\n6 Ancient Astronauts?\n7 Stonehenge\n8 King Arthur: Historical Fiction or Reality?\n9 ESP and Archaeology\n10 That Old Time Religion\n11 New Age Archaeology\n12 Plato's Atlantis\n13 Where in the World Is Atlantis?\n14 Genuine Archaeological Mysteries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aebcfd4f28631a8dc1e8aef7d34e60e2e9864447","amp;dn":"TMS+-+Myths+and+Mysteries+in+Archaeology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aebcfd4f28631a8dc1e8aef7d34e60e2e9864447","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,188,253,79,40,99,26,141,193,232,174,247,211,78,96,226,233,134,68,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
