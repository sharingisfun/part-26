Vinton's sentimental balladeering and orchestral, middle-of-the-road arrangements were a throwback to a decade earlier, before rock &amp; roll had found its mass market. If Vinton is sometimes identified with a rock &amp; roll audience, it's only because his music was bought by young listeners for a time, and because he still catches some airplay on oldies stations. What he sang was vocal pop, landing some of the biggest hits of the early '60s with &quot;Roses Are Red (My Love),&quot; &quot;Blue on Blue,&quot; &quot;There! I've Said It Again,&quot; &quot;Mr. Lonely,&quot; and &quot;Blue Velvet,&quot; the last of which has become his signature song in the wake of its notorious prominence in David Lynch's Blue Velvet.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-vinton-p3157/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-vinton-p3157/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
