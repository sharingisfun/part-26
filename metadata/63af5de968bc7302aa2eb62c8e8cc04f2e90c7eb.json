As Sydney braces itself for a Japanese invasion, Father Frank Darragh finds his pastoral duties becoming increasingly challenging. How should he counsel an AWOL black American soldier who may face death for his involvement with a white woman? And what should he say to another womanÃ¢â‚¬â€the distressingly beguiling Kate HeggartyÃ¢â‚¬â€who impresses him with her virtue even as she edges toward sin? When Kate is found murdered, Darragh falls under suspicion. And even if the police clear him, his superiorsÃ¢â‚¬â€and his own conscienceÃ¢â‚¬â€may not. Office of Innocence is a book thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impossible to put down, dense with moral complexity and alive with period detail.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63af5de968bc7302aa2eb62c8e8cc04f2e90c7eb","amp;dn":"Thomas+Keneally+-+Office+of+Innocence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63af5de968bc7302aa2eb62c8e8cc04f2e90c7eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,175,93,233,104,188,115,2,170,46,182,44,142,140,192,79,46,144,199,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
