I have published two novels, Sherlock Holmes and the Giant Rat of Sumatra and Sherlock Holmes and the Hapsburg Tiara, both available online via Amazon, Barnes and Noble, etc. The Hapsburg Tiara is also available in an unabridged audio edition, read very well by English actor Simon Vance, in cassette, CD, MP3, and digital downloadable formats, available online from Blackstone Audio. I do not own any cats, but I do have an extremely large TV set. I enjoy reading about dinosaurs and British parliamentary figures, in that order.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1125ed23045e629a7b9c48bf5caddd6f1f19dc4f","amp;dn":"alan+vaneman+three+bullets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1125ed23045e629a7b9c48bf5caddd6f1f19dc4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,37,237,35,4,94,98,154,123,156,72,191,92,173,221,111,31,25,220,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
