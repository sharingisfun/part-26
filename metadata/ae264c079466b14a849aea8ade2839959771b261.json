After a few line-up changes Malpractice steadied to Joonas Koto and Tuomo PÃƒÂ¤rttÃƒÂ¶ on guitars, Miikka Tikka on drums, Petri Vuorio on bass and Mika Uronen on vocals. Malpractice started out as a thrash-metal band but soon after the release of their first self-financed CD-EP &quot;Memorial&quot; (May 1996), thrash influences were cast aside by more melodic and progressive elements. In December of the same year Malpractice released their second CD-EP &quot;Frozen&quot; which soon gained interest in Germany, France and Italy. Both EP's are now out of print.\n\nThe spring of 1997 ended an era in Malpractice. Bass player Petri Vuorio left the band. His replacement Jonas MÃƒÂ¤ki joined the band and gave Malpractice a needed kick in the ass. New great material was composed in a very short period of time. Still without a recording deal Malpractice started to record a full-length album in March 1998 at Music Bros studio in Imatra Finland with engineer Miitri Aaltonen. The sessions were finally over in August and the first full-length album &quot;Of Shape And Balance&quot; was out in September. One of the record companies who showed interest in Malpractice's masterpiece was Finnish Mastervox Records. After a few months of negotiations Malpractice signed a deal with Mastervox. In the fall of 1998 Tuomo PÃƒÂ¤rttÃƒÂ¶ left Malpractice. He was replaced by former Cornucopia guitarist Sami Pesonen. Next one to leave was drummer Miikka Tikka. Their ways parted in May 1999. He was replaced by Toni Paananen. Now with the best possible line-up, Malpractice began to write new material for the forthcoming releases. In 2001 they recorded a three song demo-CD called &quot;Between Divided Platforms&quot; and 2002 another demo-CD titled &quot;Triangular&quot;.\n\nIn 2004 Malpractice activated again to record yet another demo-CD titled &quot;Circles And Lines&quot;. This brilliant demo caught the attention of the leading Finnish record company Spinefarm. Malpractice signed a deal with Spinefarm in December 2004. The recordings of Malpractice's second full length album &quot;Deviation From The Flow&quot; took place in April 2005 at Astia Studio with producer Anssi Kippo.\n\nThe latest addition to Malpractice is guitarist Markus Vanhala (Manitou, Omnium Gatherum) who took over Sami Pesonen's duties since Sami's work assignments took him abroad and so it became impossible to continue with him.\n2008 release of their third album, Triangular, which not only expanded their forward-thinking style, also reinvigorated some of their early thrash elements. In 2010 the band self-produced their own outstanding demo, which eventually became their fourth album, Turning Tides. As their contract with Spinefarm was expired, the band sought new pastures, and given the more melodic and progressive nature of their style, found solace in Laser's Edge offshoot, Sensory Records, who is now preparing Turning Tides for proper worldwide release this summer.\nTurning Tides represents Malpractice at their absolute best, combing intricate progressive metal with catchy melodies topped with excellent musicianship and brilliant vocal harmonies. Final release details on Turning Tides will be released in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf Shape and Balance\n\n   Label: Mastervox Records\n   Released: 1998\n\n   1. We Become One\n   2.
