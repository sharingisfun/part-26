Her confessor is in collusion with the Mother Superior. Maria is tortured, forced into sex with men, women, and the horned Devil, and told that it's all a bad dream. She writes a letter to God, and a Knight rescues her, only to fall into the hands of the Inquisition, put on the rack, and condemned to death like Joan of Arc.\nSummary written by Artemis-9\n\nSource: DVD-5\nXviD: 1403 kbps\nMP3: 192 kbps\nResolution: 640x358\nFPS: 25 (PAL)\nQuality: Pretty good\nSubs: Yes, see below\n\nThe audio is English and OVERDUBBED.  That means the mouth and words won't match since the original is a different language.  I ripped the subs too but the subs are different (English) words, as if it was a direct translation from the movie.\n\nCheck out IMDB to find out more: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076312/\n\nA similiar up by me on TPB:  The Halfway House - http://thepiratebay.se/search.php?q=The+Halfway+House\n\nThis is a disturbing movie and really makes you think. It is a pretty good movie though. I want to mention that because of the subs and the audio being the way they are, that don't make this a &quot;poor&quot; copy or a bad movie. This is straight from the DVD release and the subs I ripped and checked out make sure they worked right. I just don't want anyone to overlook this because of audio or subs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f4e886be3f9a8cc8e5aa3e773c30b95e6c63360","amp;dn":"Love+Letters+of+a+Portuguese+Nun+%281977%29+XviD-dvdrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f4e886be3f9a8cc8e5aa3e773c30b95e6c63360","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,78,136,107,227,249,168,204,142,90,163,231,115,195,11,149,230,198,51,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
