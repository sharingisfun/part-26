That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n=================================\nWe are definitely in the home stretch now.\n\nAfter this torrent, i.e. part 46, there are about 155-160gb to go in the projected 10 remaining torrents.\n\n741gb Done so far\n\nc. 920gb projected total\n\nProjected remaining torrents and approximate file sizes. Several of these still have significant work needed and the size could go up or down. I'm betting on down for the last 3.\n\n17G\t47\tTe-Tn\n17G\t48\tTo-Unk\n18G\t49\tUnl-Wes\n17G\t50\tWet-Wn\n14G\t51\tWonder Woman, Wonder Girl\n16G\t52\tWor-Wq\n14G\t53\tWr-Z\n17G\t54\tFill Torent a-b\n14G\t55\tFill Torent c-i\n16G\t56\tFill Torent j-z\n\n        And then goodbye to uploading, and this time, I mean it. There will be no nagging sense of incompleteness to bring me back as there was after the original MTCDC series. When this is over, I'm out of here. I may even drop the joshua13 identity entirely and do whatever else I still do on the internet as (name withheld). My accounts on torrent sites would still exist to preserve the torrents, but I would never log in to them.\n\n=================================\n\nToday's offering: DC from Swe-Td\n\nEnjoy!\n\nSweatshop 01-06 (2003)\n\nSweet Tooth 01-xx (Vertigo(2009-20xx)\n\nSwing with Scooter 01-36 (1966-1972)\n\nSword of Sorcery 01-05 (1973)\n\nSword of the Atom 01-04 (1983)\n\nSword of the Atom Specials 01-03 (1984-1988)\n\nSword of the Dark Ones v1-v3 covers only\n\nSwordquest 01-03 (1982-1983)\n\nSystem, The 01-03 (Vertigo VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ritÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©(1996)\n\nTailgunner Jo 01-06 (1988-1989)\n\nTainted-Vertigo Voices (1995).cbr\n\nTakion 01-07 (1995-1996)\n\nTalent Showcase 16-19(i) after New TS 15 (1985)\n\nTales of Ghost Castle 01-03 (1975)\n\nTales of the Dark Knight-Batman's First Fifty Years 1939-1989-Cotta Vaz, M. 274p (1989).cbr\nTales of the Dark Knight-Batman's First Fifty Years 1939-1989-Cotta Vaz, M. 274p (1989).pdf  The pdf is searchable text, not a collection of images.\n\nTales of the Green Lantern Corps 01-03 (1981)\nTales of the Green Lantern Corps Annual 01-03 (1985-1987)\nTales of the Green Lantern Corps-Ion 001.cbr\n\nTales of the Legion of Super-Heroes v1 314-354 (after LoSH 313) (1984-1985)\nTales of the Legion of Super-Heroes v1 Annual 04-05 after LOSH ann 03 (1986-1987) New stuff only\n\nTales of the New Gods TPB (2008).cbr\n\nTales of the New Teen Titans 01-04 (1982)\n\nTales of the Sinestro Corps-Cyborg Superman 001 ctc.cbr\nTales of the Sinestro Corps-Parallax 001-2 covers ctc.cbr\nTales of the Sinestro Corps-Superman Prime 001.cbr\n\nTales of the Teen Titans v1 41-59 (After NTT 40 (1984-1985)\nTales of the Teen Titans v1 Annual  03-04 (After NTT v1 Annual 02) (1984-1986)\n\nTales of the Unexpected v1 01-104 becomes The Unexpected (1956-1981)\nTales of the Unexpected v2 01-08 (2006-2007)\n\nTaleweaver 01-06 (WS(2001-2002)\n\nTalos of the Wilderness Sea 001 (1987).cbr\n\nTangent Comics - A special DC Imprint dealing with &quot;Earth Tangent&quot;, an alternate reality with heroes of the same name as the DCU, but otherwise quote different.\n     Tangent Comics Preview 1997.cbz\n     Tangent Comics v1 (1997)\n     Tangent Comics v1-Doom Patrol (1997).cbr\n     Tangent Comics v1-Green Lantern (1997).cbr\n     Tangent Comics v1-Metal Men (1997).cbr\n     Tangent Comics v1-Nightwing (1997).cbr\n     Tangent Comics v1-Sea Devils (1997).cbr\n     Tangent Comics v1-Secret Six (1997).cbr\n     Tangent Comics v1-The Atom (1997).cbr\n     Tangent Comics v1-The Flash (1997).cbr\n     Tangent Comics v1-The Joker (1997).cbr\nTangent Comics v2 (1998)\n     Tangent Comics v2-JLA (1998).cbz\n     Tangent Comics v2-Nightwing Night Force (1998).cbr\n     Tangent Comics v2-Powergirl (1998).cbr\n     Tangent Comics v2-Superman (1998).cbr\n     Tangent Comics v2-Tales of the Green Lantern (1998).cbr\n     Tangent Comics v2-The Batman (1998).cbr\n     Tangent Comics v2-The Joker's Wild (1998).cbr\n     Tangent Comics v2-Trials of The Flash (1998).cbr\n     Tangent Comics v2-Wonder Woman (1998).cbr\nTangent-Superman's Reign 01-11 (2008-2009) Ten years later on Earth Tangent\n\n\nTank Girl\n     Tank Girl (Dark Horse\n          Tank Girl 2 01-04 (1993-1995)\n          Tank Girl v1 01-04 (1991)\n\n     Tank Girl (IDW\n          Tank Girl-The Gifting 01-04 (2007)\n          Tank Girl-The Royal Escape 01-04 (2010)\n          Tank Girl-Visions of Booga 01-04 (2008)\n\n     Tank Girl (Titan\n          Tank Girl-Bad Wind Rising 01-03 (2011)\n          Tank Girl-Skidmarks 01-04 (2009-2010)\n\n     Tank Girl (Vertigo\n          Tank Girl Apocalypse 01-04 (1995-96)\n          Tank Girl Odyssey 01-04 (1995)\n\n     Tank Girl Graphic Novel (Penguin(1990).cbr\n     Tank Girl-The Movie (1995).cbr\n\nTarget-Superman 001 15p (Kenner Toys(1995).cbr\n\n     Tarzan got singled out to have everything I could find tossed in. I haven't always done for characters that have a long history with many publishers out of size concerns. So some times you just got a sampling. Phantom is the outstanding example of that. There is just a huge amount of scanned Phantom. I shared over 33gb in 3 torrents back in july 2009 and those appear to be still seeded according to thetorrent site. It wasn't actually all Phantom. There is a long running Indian comic that prints the adventures of The Phantom, Mandrake The Magician and others and I did not seperate out just the Phantom from that.\n\nHere's links to the Phantom -  which was complete at the time and included newly scanned and never before torrented items. There have been comics printed and scanned since then.\n\nSince TPB does not like links to other torrent sites, minus signs were added to fool the censor bot.\n\n  \n\n\n     I call doing this &quot;The treatment&quot;. Star Trek got it, I've done other. Today Tarzan gets &quot;the Treatment&quot;. There are probably a few Tarzan comics that have been scanned that I don't have, and there may plenty more that have yet to be scanned, but this is a pretty good set.\n     I watched a lot of Tarzan movies and TV shows as kid, that's probably why I feel a soft spot for him. He remains a well known figure around the world. He's not at his height of popularity right now, but he's not out yet. You never know when he might make a comeback in the movies, TV or comics. Actually I am a bit surprised that there hasn't been a Hollywood movie about him in so long. They have been so interested in remakes and sequels, that I'd think they'd give this guy another go round. Last live action English language theatrical movie appears to have been in 1998, and that was the first since 1984. There were the Disney animated films, fine for what they are, but not what I'm talking about\n     Where's that&quot;gritty reboot&quot; where Tarzan is &quot;going all Batman&quot; on poachers and terrorists in Africa? Meanwhile he's getting divorced from Jane after an affair with a Mossad agent he worked with fighting a terrorist plot that threatened gorillas as a side effect, and is struggling with a booze and cocaine habit - but he's been clean for 6 months. Some people think he's a loose cannon, but many see him as a genuine hero. Meanwhile &quot;Cheetah&quot; would probably not be in this, but if he were he'd  be the product of an unethical genetic experiment by some evil scientist, probably first step in a project aimed at creating animal human hybrid soldiers down the road They would totally steal as much from Planet of the Apes as they could, and any other recent successful movie. He'd have learned how to fire guns and plant explosives thanks to his enhanced intelligence, and he'd be waging war on poachers who kill Chimpanzees and others who destroy habitat Chimpanzees need. Estranged from Tarzan because of his embracement of extreme violence and possibly terroristic tactics in defense of animals, they come together once again in this movie to fight a threat so big, so horrible in it's conception, we can't reveal it for fear the very thought would make you whimper like an injured puppy. Plus I may want to sell this movie idea to Hollywood. We could use that line in the trailer voice-over.\n\nTarzan\n     Burroughs Bulletin 01-xx (1962-19xx) 16 issues\n     Jungle Tales of Tarzan 01-04 (Charlton(1964-1965)\n     March of Comics 125-Tarzan (1954).cbr\n\n     Tarzan (Byblos\n          Tarzan Monthly 3 issues\n          Tarzan Weekly 3 issues\n\n     Tarzan (DC\n          100-Page Super Spectacular DC-19-Tarzan 100p (08-1973).cbr\n          Batman-Tarzan-Claws of the Cat-Woman 01-04 (1999)\n          Korak-Son of Tarzan 46-59 (1964-1975)\n          Limited Collectors' Edition C-22-Tarzan of the Apes (1973).cbr\n          Limited Collectors' Edition C-29-Return of Tarzan (1974).cbr\n          Superman-Tarzan-Sons of the Jungle 01-03 (2001-2002)\n          Tarzan 207-258-after GK 206 (DC(1972-1977)\n          Tarzan Digest 001 (1972).cbr\n          Tarzan Family 60-66-after Gold Key Korak (1975-1976)\n          Weird Worlds 01-03 (1972)\n\n     Tarzan (Dark Horse\n          Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan the Untamed.cbz\n          Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan-A Tales of Mugambi (1995).cbr\n          Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan-Carson of Venus TPB (1999).cbr\n          Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan-Rivers of Blood 01-04 (1999)\n          Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan-The Lost Adventure 01-04 (1995)\n          Edgar Rice Burroughs' The Return of Tarzan 01-03 (1997)\n          Tarzan In the Land That Time Forgot &amp; The Pool of Time (1996).cbr\n          Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar (Russ Manning)(1999).cbr\n          Tarzan v1 01-20 (1996-1998)\n          Tarzan vs Predator at the Earth's Core TPB (1997).cbr\n          Tarzan vs Predator-At the Earth's Core 01-04 (1996)\n          Tarzan-Carson of Venus 01-04 (1998)\n          Tarzan-John Carter, Warlords of Mars 01-04 (1996)\n          Tarzan-The Savage Heart 01-04 (1999)\n\n     Tarzan (Dell\n          Dell Giant 025-Tarzan's Jungle World.cbr\n          Dell Giant 037-Tarzan King of the Jungle (1960).cbr\n          Dell Giant 051-Tarzan.cbz\n          Four Color Comics 0134-Tarzan.cbr\n          Four Color Comics 0161-Tarzan.cbr\n          Tarzan 001-131-moves to GK at 132\n          Tarzan's Jungle Annual 01-07 (1952-1958)\n\n     Tarzan (Gold Key\n          Edgar Rice Burroughs Korak, Son of Tarzan 01-45 (46 is DC) (1964-1969)\n          Golden Comics Digest 009-Tarzan.cbr\n          Tarzan of the Apes 132-206-after Dell 131\n\n     Tarzan 001 (Kiran Publications(1979).cbr\n     \n     Tarzan (Malibu\n          Tarzan the Beckoning 01-07 (1992-1993)\n          Tarzan the Warrior 01-05 (1992)\n     Tarzan-Loves Lies and the Lost City 01-03 (1992)\n\n     Tarzan (Newspaper\n          Tarzan Dailies Newspaper\n               Tarzan Daily Comic (1950-1954)\n               Tarzan-Russ Manning Dailies\n                The Illustrated Tarzan Books 013.cbr\n          Tarzan Sunday Newspaper\n               1 - Russ Manning\n               2 - Gil Kane\n               3 - Gray Morrow\n               4 - Eric Battle\n              Single Series 020-Tarzan.cbr\n               Young Tarzan.cbr\n     Tarzan Book no 1-Hal Foster reprint 1929 daily strips.cbr\n     Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar-J Allen St John 02-1918 10-06-28 Wichita Eagle.cbr\n     Tarzan by Foster-0940-Single Series 020.cbr\n     Tarzan-The Maneater-Gil Kane 002.cbr\n\n     Tarzan (Top Sellers\n          Korak 033 (1974).cbr\n          Korak-Son of Tarzan 100  Australian (Top Sellers(1975).cbr\n          Tarzan (Top Sellers 9 issues\n\n     Tarzan (Vidyarthy Mithram 2 issues\n\n     Tarzan (Westworld/Tarzan Adventures (Westworld 11 issues\n\n     Tarzan (Westworld/Tarzan-The Grand Adventure Comic - 7 Issues\n\n     Tarzan Marvel\n          Tarzan of the Apes v1 01-02 (1984)\n          Tarzan v1 01-29 (1977-1979)\n          Tarzan v1 Annual 01-03  (1977-1979)\n\n     Tarzan of the Apes-Fortnightly (Williams Publishing 2 issues\n\n     Trading Cards\n          Tarzan Bubble Gum Cards (Banner 1966).cbr\n          Tarzan Cards 001 66-Missing 06,24,31 33,37,45 47 (1966).cbz\n\nTattered Banners 01-04 (Vertigo(1998-99)\n\n=====================================================================\n\nFeel free to post this to other sites if you know how and are so inclined\n\n========================================================================\n\nPlease Seed!
