CoplinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s characters are deeply rooted in the mystery of the American West, and she brings them together, like the grafting of TalmadgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trees, to form a unique family bound not by blood but by the shared experience of tragedy, the land, and ultimately fate.\n\n\n\nSome reviews:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Many contemporary novelists have revisited the question of what constitutes a family, but few have responded in a voice as resolute and fiercely poetic.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (New York Times Book Review )\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Amanda CoplinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s somber, majestic debut arrives like an urgent missive from another century. You can only be thrilled by a 31-year-old writer with this depth of understandingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦the final epiphany equals in stark grandeur similar scenes in Emily BronteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s WUTHERING HEIGHTS and Pat BarkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ANOTHER WORLD...Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Washington Post )\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Patiently beautiful, THE ORCHARDIST builds its characters and its situations so carefully that the story becomes as real to us as this morningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s news. I am in awe of Amanda CoplinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book, which does not feel like a first novel but a lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Charles Baxter, author THE FEAST OF LOVE, National Book Award Finalist )\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51f27f9bb3c431ba93b8a61fe288147c812e0e8d","amp;dn":"Amanda+Coplin+%282012%29.+The+Orchardist%3A+A+Novel-LittleBlueGirl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51f27f9bb3c431ba93b8a61fe288147c812e0e8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,242,127,155,179,196,49,186,147,184,166,31,226,136,20,124,129,46,14,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
