DeMatteis\n\nArtists - John J. Muth, Kent Williams, George Pratt\n\n\nThe story takes the form of an eclectic and quirky fairy tale with satirical elements and dealing with philosophical concerns. It is told via the framing device of Moonshadow, now 120, looking back on his earlier life. The action concerns the events leading up to the &quot;awakening&quot; of Moonshadow, the child of a hippy mother and a enigmatic alien father. The alien, who resembles a glowing orb of light bearing a stylized human face, abducted Moonshadow's mother from Earth in 1968 along with her black pet cat, Frodo. When the idealistic and naive Moonshadow is orphaned at approximately age 15, he becomes friends with a venal and opportunistic furry humanoid named Ira. Moonshadow and Ira and Frodo the cat set out to find a life for themselves in the stars.\n\nMoonshadow loses his innocence, but eventually makes peace with the world and reconciles himself to the actions of his seemingly capricious alien father.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart of the 'Restoration' process is done to make it possible to enlarge these images. As such, after you have opened the files in a comic book reader some of you may actually need to shrink them down a bit to improve the image quality.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2b8baf4967ad6c548c69b2b24eb66f770933a1a","amp;dn":"Moonshadow+%28Restored%29+%28Vertigo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2b8baf4967ad6c548c69b2b24eb66f770933a1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,184,186,244,150,122,214,197,72,198,155,43,36,235,102,247,112,147,58,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
