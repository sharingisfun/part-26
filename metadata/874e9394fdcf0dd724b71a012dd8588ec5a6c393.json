YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll only ever play as Lee and will see the world from his point of view.\n\nBringing the world of The Walking Dead to life.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nYou play the game as Lee Everett, a man convicted of a crime, but who is offered a chance at redemptionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦albeit in a world overtaken by walkers. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll only ever play as Lee and will see the world from his point of view.\n\nTelltale has a strong history of releasing episodic games but more importantly, we wanted this game to offer an experience analogous to the comic books and TV show, which are also episodic in nature. We have plans for 5 episodes, releasing once per month.\n\nThe Walking Dead is an Adventure Horror game. This game will offer a different experience compared to many other zombie-based games. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be mowing down hordes of the undead as a super-powered killing machine with unlimited ammo; that would not be an accurate recreation of Robert KirkmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world. When you do tangle with the undead, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to be harrowing. That walker could be someone you once knewÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or were very close to. Also, gunfire (or loud noises in general) are not good in areas where walkers could be lurking.\n\n\n\nSystem requirements Core 2 Duo 2 GHz, 2 GB RAM (4 GB RAM Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Vista/7), graphic card 1 GB (GeForce GTX 460 or better), 2 GB HDD, Windows XP/Vista/7\n\n\nInstallation notes:\n\n1.
