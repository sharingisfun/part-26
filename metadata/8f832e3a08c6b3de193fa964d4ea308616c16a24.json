I have played it hundreds and hundreds of times. It has quite a few pops, clicks and crackles, but it is amazing with modern technology that we can enjoy it without those annoyances. That is what I've provided. I have most of Thelonious' albums and Brilliant Corners is my favorite. \n\n                 Remember what Thelonious said: &quot;There are no wrong notes&quot;\n\n\nThese Vinyl rips were recorded on a Denon DP-45F turntable using an Audio Technica AT120E cartridge. The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).\nRecorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.\niZotope was easily the most important part of this process. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32 bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32 bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 24-96 FLAC files and 320 bitrate mp3 at 48 kHz sample rate.\n\nThis is A Lot of work folks!\n\n\n                                   Brilliant Corners\n\n\nBrilliant Corners is a 1957 album by jazz musician Thelonious Monk. It was his third album for the Riverside label and the first, for this label, to include his own compositions. The complex title track required over a dozen takes in the studio, and is considered one of his most difficult compositions. In 2003, it was one of fifty recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry.\n\nBecause of its historical significance the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.[1]\n\nThe track Pannonica is named for Pannonica de Koenigswarter, a close friend of Monk's.\n[edit] Track listing\n\nAll compositions by Thelonious Monk unless otherwise indicated.\n\n   1. &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:42\n   2. &quot;Ba-lue Bolivar Ba-lues-are&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 13:24\n   3. &quot;Pannonica&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:50\n   4. &quot;I Surrender Dear&quot; (Harry Barris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:25\n   5. &quot;Bemsha Swing&quot; (Thelonious Monk, Denzil Best) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:42\n\n[edit] Personnel\n\nMusicians\n\n    * Thelonious Monk ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ piano; celeste on Pannonica\n    * Ernie Henry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ alto saxophone on Brilliant Corners, Ba-lue Bolivar Ba-lues-are and Pannonica\n    * Sonny Rollins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ tenor saxophone\n    * Oscar Pettiford ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ double bass on Brilliant Corners, Ba-lue Bolivar Ba-lues-are and Pannonica\n    * Max Roach ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ drums; timpani on Bemsha Swing\n\n    * Clark Terry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ trumpet on Bemsha Swing\n    * Paul Chambers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ double bass on Bemsha Swing\n\nProduction\n\n    * Orrin Keepnews ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ producer\n    * Jack Higgins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ engineer\n    * Joe Tarantino ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ mastering\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f832e3a08c6b3de193fa964d4ea308616c16a24","amp;dn":"%7B24-96%7D+Thelonious+Monk+-+Brilliant+Corners+-+FLAC+-+320+-+Vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f832e3a08c6b3de193fa964d4ea308616c16a24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,131,46,58,8,198,179,222,25,63,169,100,212,234,48,134,22,193,106,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
