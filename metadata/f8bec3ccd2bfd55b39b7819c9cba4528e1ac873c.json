PureVideo HD includes required content protection circuitry (HDCP) for playing the new Blu-ray and HD DVD movies at the highest quality possible, and is directly integrated with the leading HD movie software players. PureVideo HD delivers the ultimate high-definition movie experience on a PC.\n\nDiscrete, Programmable Video Processor\nNVIDIA PureVideo HD technology is a discrete programmable processing core in certain NVIDIA GeForce GPUs that provides superb picture quality and ultra-smooth movies with low CPU utilization and power consumption.\n\nHardware Decode Acceleration\nProvides ultra-smooth playback of H.264, VC-1, WMV and MPEG-2 HD and standard-definition movies with minimal CPU use.\n\nBit-stream Processing\nExecutes the reverse entropy decompression portion of H.264 decoding, freeing the CPU to do other tasks, such as recording television shows in the background.\n\nHDCP Capable1\nMeets the output protection management (HDCP) and security specifications of Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD formats, allowing playback of encrypted movie content on HDCP-compliant displays.\n\nAdvanced Spatial-Temporal De-Interlacing\nSharpens interlaced content on progressive displays, delivering a crisp, clear picture that rivals high-end home-theater systems.\n\nHigh-Quality Scaling\nEnlarges lower resolution movies and videos to HDTV resolutions, up to 1080i, while maintaining a clear image. Also provides downscaling of videos, while preserving image detail.\n\nInverse Telecine (3:2 &amp; 2:2 Pulldown Correction)\nRecovers original film images from films-converted-to-video (DVDs, 1080i HD content), providing more accurate movie playback and superior picture quality. Requires supported video software.\n\nBad Edit Correction\nWhen videos are edited, the edits can disrupt the pulldown cadence. PureVideo technology uses advanced processing techniques to detect poor edits, recover the original content, and display improved picture detail frame after frame for smooth video.\n\nVideo Color Correction\nCorrects differences in color characteristics of RGB and TV monitors, ensuring videos are not too dark, overly bright or washed out.\n\nIntegrated SD and HD TV Output\nSupports Composite, S-Video, Component, DVI or HDMI output at resolutions up to 1080p, depending on connection type and TV capability.\n\nNoise Reduction\nImproves movie image quality by removing unwanted artifacts.\n\nEdge Enhancement \nSharpens movie images by providing higher contrast around lines and objects.\n\nHD Movie Player Integration\nNVIDIA PureVideo HD technology powers some of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leading HD movie player software applications, providing the ultimate HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc movie experience.\n\nInstallation:\n=============\n\n1.
