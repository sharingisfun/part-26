Dewars vocal is powerfully sincere and Trowers  backing guitar is subtle and delicate, while his lead lines soar, with a fairly clean sound and amazing sustain.  A tour-de-force. \nI&amp;#039;ve loved this album for 30 years and I don&amp;#039;t think there&amp;#039;s a bad track on it. \n\nToo Rolling Stoned\nDaydream\nRock Me Baby\nLady Love\nI Can&amp;#039;t Wait Much Longer\nAlethea\nLittle Bit of Sympathy\n\n\n - also in this torrent, an earlier studio album.  \nSome fine tracks on here too. \n\nFOR EARTH BELOW \n\nShame The Devil\nIt&amp;#039;s Only Money\nConfessin&amp;#039; Midnight\nFine Day\nAlethea\nA Tale Untold\nGonna Be More Suspicious...
