From the weird and slimey, to more \nsubtle toned skins, these textures are made up from many layers and elements captured by 50% photography \nand 50% hand painted. Many textures have several combined layers resulting in the examples you can \nsee here. Of course like all of our textures they are 100% seamless and have additional hand crafted \nextras such as matching bump maps, many have specular maps too.\n\nThe average texture size is 1024 pixels on each axis but some range a little higher. All of \nthe textures are jpeg format (saved at the highest quality setting) and so are compatible with \nall 3d and 2d software.\n\nAs with all of our CDs there is a interface which runs in your browser (works on all PCs and Macs) \nto enable easy texture previewing and selection. Plus access to the extras bonus material in the form \nof tutorials and project overviews. These give an insight into how the textures can be used. \n\n\nhttp://www.3dtotal.com/\n\n&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://www.3dtotal.com/services/cds_new/v11/main.jpg&quot; BORDER=0 ALT=0&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2052ae9ef3c07b3499e9cfc134912705dcdf7d8","amp;dn":"3D.TOTAL.TEXTURES.VOL.11-ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2052ae9ef3c07b3499e9cfc134912705dcdf7d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,5,42,233,239,60,7,179,73,158,156,252,19,73,18,112,93,205,247,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
