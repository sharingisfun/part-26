Now Garfield takes on a subject even dearer to our fanatical human hearts: maps.\n \nImagine a world without maps. How would we travel? Could we own land? What would men and women argue about in cars? Scientists have even suggested that mappingÃ¢â‚¬â€not languageÃ¢â‚¬â€is what elevated our prehistoric ancestors from ape-dom. Follow the history of maps from the early explorersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ maps and the awe-inspiring medieval Mappa Mundi to Google Maps and the satellite renderings on our smartphones, Garfield explores the unique way that maps relate and realign our historyÃ¢â‚¬â€and reflect the best and worst of what makes us human.\n \nFeaturing a foreword by Dava Sobel and packed with fascinating tales of cartographic intrigue, outsize personalities, and amusing Ã¢â‚¬Å“pocket mapsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on an array of subjects from how to fold a map to the strangest maps on the Internet, On the Map is a rich historical tapestry infused with GarfieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature narration.\n \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ac8c426d2e575e5363ce8920e8b78f7d976fc56","amp;dn":"%5BDec+2012%5D+Simon+Garfield+-+On+The+Map+-+Why+the+world+looks+the","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ac8c426d2e575e5363ce8920e8b78f7d976fc56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,200,196,38,210,229,117,229,54,60,232,146,14,139,120,247,217,118,252,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
