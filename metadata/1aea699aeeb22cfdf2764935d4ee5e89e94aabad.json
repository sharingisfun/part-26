Roth plays\nTrevor, a skinhead with a swastika tattoo on his forehead who\nlashes out verbally and sometimes physically at everything\nthat surrounds him. Cinematographer Chris Menges (who would\ngo on to win Oscars for his work on The Killing Fields and\nThe Mission), gets his camera right in Roth's snarling face,\nas the film tracks Trevor's progress through the British\njustice system. In the courtroom, charged with attacking a\nPakistani man and vandalizing his store, Trevor displays\nabsolutely no remorse as he matter-of-factly admits that he\nknew the man would have to be hospitalized for his injuries.\nTrevor's social worker, Harry (Eric Richard), recognizes\nTrevor's intelligence, but he's running out of ways to\nconvince Trevor to straighten out his life. Harry takes him\nto a juvenile detention center for &quot;assessment,&quot; after which\nhe'll be sentenced. Trevor immediately dismisses Peter\n(Bill Stewart), the put-upon supervisor of the center, as a\n&quot;wanker.&quot; He meets his black roommate, Errol (Terry Richards),\nwhom he quickly convinces to come out with him on a car-stealing,\nglue-sniffing, job-center-vandalizing day trip. Brazenly returning\nto the detention center in a stolen car, Trevor eventually\nprovokes Peter into locking him in a classroom, so a police\nsuperintendent (Geoffrey Hutchings) can harangue him about the\nhopeless path his life is taking. Trevor refuses to accept the\ncenter's (and society's) standards for &quot;good behavior,&quot; raging\nthat they all just want everyone to follow the rules and keep\ntheir mouths shut. The script was written by David Leland (Wish\nYou Were Here) and the songs on the soundtrack are by the anarchist\nhardcore band the Exploited.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084287/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084287/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/40445387500241185219.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/40445387500241185219.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/32900354318735354519.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/32900354318735354519.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/57281391810372765691.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/57281391810372765691.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aea699aeeb22cfdf2764935d4ee5e89e94aabad","amp;dn":"Made+In+Britain+dvdrip+Xvid+%5BBig+A+Little+A%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aea699aeeb22cfdf2764935d4ee5e89e94aabad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,234,105,154,238,178,44,253,242,118,73,53,212,238,94,137,233,74,171,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
