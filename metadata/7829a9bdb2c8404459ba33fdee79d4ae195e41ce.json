He begins by examining the common criticisms to materialism, then he states the principles of scientific materialism in an exact, precise and systematic way. Subsequently, the author implacably criticizes dialectics, teleology, psycho-physical dualism and other doctrines that are incompatible with logic or science. He also formulates three new theories on mind, values and culture. Finally, he attacks Popper's doctrine of the 3 worlds and Berkeley's idealism. This book will be very valuable for anyone interested in having a clear, rational, realistic and scientific conception of the world.
