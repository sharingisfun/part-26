He was killed by a hit and run driver when Rose was just a baby and among her many regrets was that her father died alone, just lying on the street. Rose asks the Doctor to take her back to that day. Rather than just be with him when he dies, she actually saves him and later admits that this was her plan all along. She soon realizes that her parents' marriage was not exactly the golden relationship she had claimed it to be. Far worse however, is that by saving her father, Rose has created a tear in space and time with the result that creatures are now feasting on humans. The Doctor isn't sure he'll be able to make everything right. Pete knows what he has to do, however. \n\nAll Torrents are seeded for 24 hours at 150mb/s rate.\n\nBrought to you by Movie-Kingdom &amp; Friends!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3aa8f93eaf55ec7826fc6aed091fa78a099a84b","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+S01E08+-+Movie-Kingdom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3aa8f93eaf55ec7826fc6aed091fa78a099a84b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,170,143,147,234,245,94,199,130,111,198,174,208,145,250,120,160,153,168,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
