It illuminates the footsteps of an integrated worldview, penetrating its way through the power of social networks to the forefront of our personal and collective awareness.\n\n\nA refreshing reality check for all viewers and a clarion call for those who carry the seeds of the emerging worldview.\n\n\nScientists and thinkers featured in *Crossroads* include: Amit Goswami, Neale Donald Walsch, Elisabet Sahtouris, Bruce Lipton, Peter Joseph, Caroline A.
