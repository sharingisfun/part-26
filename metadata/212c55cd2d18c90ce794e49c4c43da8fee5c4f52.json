There will be four and each will be a vision of this great museum by a different artist. De CrÃƒÂ©cy, at the sight of the incredible richness of the museum's collection was overwhelmed and felt small and ignorant. The result is a story set thousands of years hence in a glacial period where all human history has been forgotten and a small group of archeologists fall upon the Louvre, buried in age-old snow. They cannot begin to explain all the artifacts they see. What could they have meant? Their interpretations are nonsense, absurd, farcical.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:212c55cd2d18c90ce794e49c4c43da8fee5c4f52","amp;dn":"Nicolas+De+Crecy+-+Glacial+Period","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"212c55cd2d18c90ce794e49c4c43da8fee5c4f52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,44,85,205,45,24,201,12,231,148,228,156,76,67,218,143,238,92,79,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
