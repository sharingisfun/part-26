This exhibition and catalogue celebrate not only the remarkable collection of children's materials in the library's Department of Special Collections but also the foresight of such UCLA librarians as Wilbur Jordan Smith, F. Brooke Whiting, and James Davis, who began building this collection long before the subject of childhood became a central issue for both the academy and society. Picturing Childhood also attests to the Grunwald Center's steadfast interest in the intricate interrelationships among words and images and art and technology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e73dbd9a34d72467b9efd6d8a1093aa275b45710","amp;dn":"Picturing+Childhood%3A+Illustrated+Children%5C%27s+Books+from+Universi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e73dbd9a34d72467b9efd6d8a1093aa275b45710","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,61,189,154,52,215,36,103,185,239,214,216,161,9,58,162,117,180,87,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
