Some Americans object to socialized \nmedicine, which every other country in the world embraces.  The odd thing is that\nmost objectors tend to have health insurance, and this is the definition of socialized \nmedicine, since it spreads the insured persons costs across a larger group.  \nThe conclusion is that Americans against socialised medicine actually object to the \ngroup they are lumped in with, not to lumping in itself.  It is also possible they \nobject to perceived inefficiencies in socialized schemes, but if so, they  have it \nbackwards.  In a case where insurance companies can pick and choose who they \ninsure, they have to avoid bad risks, and cherry pick the &quot;healthy&quot; applicants.  The\ntime and expense of determining who is healthy is paid by every insurer who considers \nthe applicant, even though the applicant ultimately gets the insurance from only \none provider.  This duplication of effort is a fundamental inefficiency of allowing\ncherry picking.  Most socilized heath care schemes avoid this problem by having a single\npayer, instead of multiple insurance companies.   However, even if America wanted to preserve\nits current health insurance industry structure, with multiple firms there is a way.   \nThose insurance companies don't actually care what the cost of \nproviding health care is, they make their money by averaging it all out and adding a \nprofit margin, then charging the corresponding premiums to their customer base.  What \ninsurance companies cannot tolerate is being stuck with more unhealthy clients than \nother competing firms.   A solution is to prohibit any insurance company from cherry \npicking.  This could be done by having a 3rd party assign clients to insurance \ncompanies randomly, or by ensuring insurance companies enroll new clients without \nbeing permitted to see their health history.   It might sound strange, but that actually\nachieves the result you want, which is that companies are rewarded for delivering \nservices cost effectively to their clients, instead of being rewarded for avoiding \nclients needing health services in the first place. \n\n-- freeflow123\n\nThis release covers... \n\nA Day No Pigs Would Die\nA Death in the Family\nA Death in the Woods\nA DollÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s House\nA Farewell to Arms\nA Gathering of Old Men\nA Good Man Is Hard to Find\nA Hunger Artist\nAn Enemy of the People\nDaisy Miller\nDandelion Wine\nDangerous Liaisons\nDavid Copperfield\nDead Man Walking\nDeath Be Not Proud\nDeath in Venice\nDeath of a Salesman\nDemian\nDiary of a Young Girl\nDicey's Song\nDistant View of a Minaret\nDoctor Faustus\nDon Quixote\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\nDr. Zhivago\nDracula\nDubliners\nDune\nEast of Eden\nElectra\nEllen Foster\nEmma\nEnder's Game\nEndgame\nEthan Frome\nEveryday Use\nEverything That Rises Must Converge\nFahrenheit 451\nFallen Angels\nFar from the Madding Crowd\nFarewell to Manzanar\nFences\nFlowers for Algernon\nFool For Love\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls\nFrankenstein\nFranny and Zooey\nGhosts\nGiants in the Earth\nGilgamesh\nGirl, Interrupted\nGirl\nGlengarry Glen Ross\nGo Ask Alice\nGo Down, Moses\nGo Tell it on the Mountain\nGone with the Wind\nGreat Expectations\nGrendel\nGulliverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Travels\nhamlet\nHappy Days\nHard Times\nHarrison Bergeron\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\nHarry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\nHatchet\nHaving Our Say?
