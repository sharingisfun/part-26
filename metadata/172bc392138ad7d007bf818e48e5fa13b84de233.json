Ruth Ruth is a Punk-fueled trio with a knack for catchy pop melodies and enticing lyrics that grab the listener's ears with a vengeance. Singer/bassist Chris Kennedy's songs belie the angst and alienation he's really expressing. Ruth Ruth's aggressive musical veneer suits the material superbly - these are excellent musicians that like to Rock out in the mode of the Sex Pistols or Green Day and they have chops to spare. Laughing Gallery's overall catchiness should deservedly spread the word about Ruth Ruth further than their downtown stomping grounds.&quot; &quot;4 Stars - Excellent - ...fiercely neurotic, shamelessly tuneful Power Pop...&quot; - Q Magazine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:172bc392138ad7d007bf818e48e5fa13b84de233","amp;dn":"Ruth+Ruth+-+Laughing+Gallery+%5B1995%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"172bc392138ad7d007bf818e48e5fa13b84de233","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,43,195,146,19,138,215,208,7,191,129,142,72,229,250,19,184,77,226,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
