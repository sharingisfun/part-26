The\nname, a portmanteau of motor and town, is also a nickname for Detroit. Now headquartered\nin New York City, Motown is a subsidiary of The Island Def Jam Music Group, itself a\nsubsidiary of the French-owned Vivendi subsidiary, Universal Music Group. Motown Records\nwas also the name of Gordy's second record label; the first, Tamla Records, began on\nJanuary 12, 1959. Motown played an important role in the racial integration of popular\nmusic, by achieving a crossover success. In the 1960s, Motown and its soul-based\nsubsidiaries were the most successful proponents of what came to be known as &quot;The Motown\nSound&quot;, a style of soul music with a distinct pop influence.\n\nMotown has owned or distributed releases from more than 45 subsidiaries in varying genres,\nalthough it is most famous for its releases in the music genres of rhythm and blues, soul\nand pop. Gordy relocated Motown Records to Los Angeles in 1972 and there it remained an\nindependent company until June 28, 1988, when Gordy sold the company to MCA and Boston\nVentures (which took over full ownership of Motown in 1991), then to PolyGram in 1994,\nbefore being sold again to MCA Records' successor Universal Music Group, when it acquired\nThe PolyGram Group. As of summer of 2011, Motown has been reactivated under The Island Def\nJam Music Group division of Universal Music Group.\n\nAlbum Title:Motown Anthems [Disc - 1]\nArtist | Group:Various\nLabel:Universal Music Group\nRelease date:2012\nGenre:Motown / Pop\nFile format:flac\nBitRate:915 Kbps\nBitRate mode:VBR\nNumber of track(s):28\nTotal duration:01h:19m:12s:895ms\nTotal size:471.5341 MB\n\n\n\n01 - Supremes - Baby Love - [2mn 36s ] [ 17.3 MiB ]\n02 - Martha Reeves &amp; The Vandellas - Dancing In The Street - [2mn 37s ] [ 18.1 MiB ]\n03 - Four Tops - Reach Out, I'll Be There - [2mn 54s ] [ 17.9 MiB ]\n04 - Stevie Wonder - Uptight [Everything's Alright] - [2mn 52s ] [ 20.1 MiB ]\n05 - The Contours - Do You Love Me - [2mn 36s ] [ 15.2 MiB ]\n06 - The Marvelettes - Please Mr Postman - [2mn 28s ] [ 15.7 MiB ]\n07 - The Miracles - You Really Got A Hold On Me - [2mn 57s ] [ 13.6 MiB ]\n08 - Temptations - My Girl - [2mn 55s ] [ 15.1 MiB ]\n09 - Supremes - Where Did Our Love Go - [2mn 29s ] [ 16.0 MiB ]\n10 - Four Tops - I Can't Help Myself - [2mn 43s ] [ 14.5 MiB ]\n11 - Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles - The Tracks Of My Tears - [2mn 54s ] [ 19.5 MiB ]\n12 - Mary Wells - My Guy - [2mn 51s ] [ 17.7 MiB ]\n13 - Martha Reeves &amp; The Vandellas - Heatwave - [2mn 46s ] [ 15.3 MiB ]\n14 - The Velvelettes - Needle In A Haystack - [2mn 30s ] [ 10.7 MiB ]\n15 - Four Tops - It's The Same Old Song - [2mn 47s ] [ 16.2 MiB ]\n16 - Temptations - Get Ready - [2mn 36s ] [ 8.94 MiB ]\n17 - Supremes - Stop!
