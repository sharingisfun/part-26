Not long ago, Giorgos was on the verge of collapse. His father had kicked him out of the house and along with his friend Louka committed a series of robberies in order to find money. Fanis, his best friend, Fanis' girl Athena, and Ursula who supplied the drugs were also part of that circle. When Fanis died from overdose, and Giorgos was arrested by the police, everything seemed to have come to an end, but luckily for him Helen's love saved him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:873de38fc195bba5c52844139b2b62115e1a920e","amp;dn":"Ta+Tsakalia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"873de38fc195bba5c52844139b2b62115e1a920e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,61,227,143,193,149,187,165,197,40,68,19,155,43,98,17,94,26,146,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
