You can do it in task manager (control+alt+delete) or click the start menu and search services.msc (vista/7)\n\n\n3) Copy ALL the files from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;TVersity 1.9.7 Pro (Copy Me!)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; \n\nTO\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\TVersity\\Media Server (Default Folder)\n\n\n4) Open TVersity (it may say the server cannot connect but its ok), goto settings and under Media Sharing click \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Restart Sharing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRelease Notes\nVersion 1.9.7 (July 29, 2011)\nBug Fixes\n\nFix regression in indexing time introduced in 1.9.6 and speed indexing up to become faster than it was in 1.9.3 by a factor of 1.5 to 2.\nWindows Media Player is no longer mis-detected as a certain Samsung TV model.\n\n\nVersion 1.9.6 (July 15, 2011)\n\nPro edition: \nMore robust server side web browser with better support for BBC iPlayer.\n\nAll editions: \nAdd device profiles for WDTV Live.\nAdd device profiles for various Samsung TV models.\nAdd device profiles for Android 3.0 tablets (test with Asus Eeepad Transformer TF101). Plase note that trancoding for Android requires the Pro edition, and only Android 3.0 or higher is supported.\nAdd user contributed device profile for Logitech Revue.\nAdd user contributed device profile for Windows Phone 7.\nUpdate user contributed device profile for LG BD930.\nFaster thumbnail generaion for photos.\nBetter support for MKV and AVI transcoding.\nSupport WEBM files (transcoding requires separate installation of WEBM directshow filters available here).\nInstallation wizard now allows choosing a friendly computer name to use when discovered by other devices (i.e. this name will be displayed on TV when detected by a game console or other TV connected devices).\nPerform server side buffering for live streams to avoid stutter on devices that cannot deal with such videos properly (like the PS3 that assumes the video on demand scenario only). \nRun a CPU benchmark after installation to determine optimal transcoding settings for the system.\nMenus created from RSS/ATOM feeds are cleaner (less duplicates, and no unnecessary nesting levels).\nInstallation wizard properly configures the system for decoding of MPEG1/2 and DV (assuming proper decoder are installed), and for downmizing of multi-channel audio to stereo so that transcoding can succeed in such cases.\nMedia library indexing gives priority to local files and folders (over Internet content).\nBetter handling of high bitrate peaks when transcoding such that playback freezes are eliminated or at the very least reduced.\nInstallation wizard now configures the Windows firewall on both private and public networks when dealing with Windows 7.\nMove to latest version of ImageMagick which eliminates some rare failures to transcode photos. It also means that we do not need to modify the global ImageMagick registry key and hence we do not interfere with a normal ImageMagick installation.\nPrevent Windows from entering sleep mode when some media is streaming.\nBug Fixes \nReturn ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“text/xmlÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ as mime type of device description document as required by the UPnP standard.\nAllow pausing playback for up to 4 hours (as opposed to the 2 minute limitation in previous version).\nServer can now gracefully shut down even when something is streaming.\nFix video indexing by album and by genre.\nFix server side browse videos to continue streaming without issues even when the audio stops in the middle.\nFix some rare crashes related to image format conversion, detection of changes in IP addresses assigned to machine, tracking of file/folder changes, enter/exit sleep/hibernation mode and more.\nVarious other minor fixes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10dfc536edb475e5674429152cd0030b08ac06a2","amp;dn":"TVersity+Pro+1.9.7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10dfc536edb475e5674429152cd0030b08ac06a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,223,197,54,237,180,117,229,103,68,41,21,44,208,3,11,8,172,6,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
