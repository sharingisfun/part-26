While Rodriguez harped on the humorous cultural idiosyncrasies of being Mexican, Leguizamo twists the curve toward the New York-born Puerto Ricans, even commenting at the way people confuse the two. With vulgarity used liberally but effectively to make key points and to convey honest truths, Leguizamo does masterful imitations of family and friends as he discourses on what it's like to grow up in a dysfunctional family. He touches on Christmas, his relationship with his brother, the discovery of sexual functions, and then, growing older and dating (or in the case of chasing &quot;Rapunzel Garcia,&quot; stalking). There are also two fun musical interludes, one holiday-themed (imagine Santa visiting Puerto Ricans) and a nasty-mouthed rap tune about looking for some female action. Not full of huge laughs all the way through, this performance offers the one thing that all great comics share: the ability to make the sad truths of their lives very funny.\n\n01 - Intro\n02 - Can A Girl Be A Bastard\n03 - Ghetto Prize Or Fucked-Up White Family\n04 - Dead Santa\n05 - Fart Asphyxiation\n06 - Make The White Pee\n07 - Parents' Divorce\n08 - Single Mom\n09 - Gramps &amp; Grams\n10 - Rapunzel Garcia\n11 - Blue Balls Strategy\n12 - College Horny Dog\n13 - Penny\n14 - The Night Before Christmas\n15 - Gotta Get Some\n16 - Evelyn\n17 - My Divorce\n18 - Grampa's Pinga\n19 - High At Grampa's Funeral\n20 - Teeny-Da Woman Who Called Me On My Bullshit\n21 - Costumed X-Mas\n22 - Holes In My Condom\n23 - Sonogram-No Ding Dong\n24 - Home Birth Or Bikini Wax\n25 - Human Dairy Farm\n26 - Yakkity Yak\n27 - It's Got A Ding Dong\n28 - Airing Their Differences\n29 - Colicky Son-Or The Little Prick\n30 - Bedtime Story","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb8f5c322e34a1bb838510ae02530dbd1a1af35b","amp;dn":"John+Leguizamo+Live+%28V2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb8f5c322e34a1bb838510ae02530dbd1a1af35b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,143,92,50,46,52,161,187,131,133,16,174,2,83,13,189,26,26,243,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
