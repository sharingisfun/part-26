Taking a leap of faith she finds herself enrolling at a campus hundreds of miles away from home. \n\nShe leaves any thoughts of dating again in Jersey, that is until fate crosses her path with a blue-eyed stud named Kyler King.

When HaleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past collides with the present, will her secrets prove too big of an obstacle hindering their happily ever after, or will letting go be the key that locks their bond forever?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4153f1cf34cce6d0b006148738ac4d1f56599e4c","amp;dn":"The+Upside+of+Letting+Go+-+Nacole+Stayton.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4153f1cf34cce6d0b006148738ac4d1f56599e4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,83,241,207,52,204,230,208,176,6,20,135,56,172,77,31,86,89,158,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
