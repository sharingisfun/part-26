Ashley Meggitt and Matthew Lavy manage the LAN at Jesus College, Cambridge, and they've developed a number of scripts and techniques to bypass the GUI limitations and administer the workstations centrally. The result is Windows NT Workstation Configuration and Maintenance, the only book on the market to focus on automating the management tasks you perform daily to keep a large workstation farm up and running. Instead of trying to provide one-size-fits-all solutions to what are in reality site-specific kinds of problems, the authors concentrate on the techniques you need to master to keep your workstations under control. Their step-by-step approach shows you how to implement Perl scripts to take care of your particular problems. Topics include:\n\n* Running scripts without user intervention\n* Remote script installation\n* Controlling services and drivers\n* Machine-specific settings\n* Changing network identity\n* Perl modules and functions\n\nWindows NT Workstation Configuration and Maintenance is an indispensable tool for the busy NT system administrator.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f3ea9a19dafc0d307c8b9e551ba720189101d53","amp;dn":"Windows+NT+Workstation+Configuration+and+Maintenance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f3ea9a19dafc0d307c8b9e551ba720189101d53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,62,169,161,157,175,192,211,7,200,185,229,81,186,114,1,137,16,29,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
