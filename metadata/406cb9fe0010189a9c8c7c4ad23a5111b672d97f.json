It is, to that extent, a form that lends itself rather well to musical analogies, though not at first glance to improvised music, which tends to subordinate artful structure to moment-by-moment invention. And yet the greatest short stories can often seem improvised: brief, epiphanic flashes where the next step and the eventual outcome remain in doubt to the very end. Thereâ€™s something of the humane embrace of Chekhov, Hemingwayâ€™s muscle, reticence and resistance to mere abstraction, but perhaps itâ€™s Henry James, that master of indefinable atmospheres and of the tense dialogue between Old World and New World cultures. This is the realm Howard Riley occupies with magisterial confidence, jazz given not just a catch-all cisAtlantic accent but with Howardâ€™s distinctive burr, classical language not simply swung but put through a harmonic and rhythmic gate that transforms it utterly. How to hear him? Italo Calvino, another master of the short form, put it perfectly: â€˜It is not the voice that commands the story; it is the ear.â€™\r\n\r\nTracks:\r\n\r\nCD 1:\r\n\r\nThe Opener\t3â€˜08â€œ\r\nEleven\t2â€˜31â€œ\r\nLiason\t4â€˜25â€œ\r\nEncore\t7â€˜25â€œ\r\nEchoes\t2â€˜59â€œ\r\nNo Void\t3â€˜03â€œ\r\nStretch\t2â€˜56â€œ\r\nMythology\t6â€˜48â€œ\r\nBranching\t2â€˜12â€œ\r\nHullabaloo\t3â€˜47â€œ\r\nNew Winter 2â€˜18â€œ\r\nLargo\t2â€˜42â€œ\r\nPlayed In 2â€˜25â€œ\r\nVeracity\t1â€˜50â€œ\r\nOnly One\t2â€˜59â€œ\r\nHeadway\t1â€˜39â€œ\r\nCD 2:\r\n\r\nShort Stories 3â€˜21â€œ\r\nDedication\t5â€˜12â€œ\r\nSun One\t3â€˜50â€œ\r\nOne More Time\t2â€˜53â€œ\r\nAxis\t3â€˜19â€œ\r\nThe Furthest Point 3â€˜47â€œ\r\nAfter Which\t4â€˜49â€œ\r\nAir Time\t2â€˜14â€œ\r\nAlternatives\t2â€˜10â€œ\r\nRegeneration 4â€˜21â€œ\r\nFor Jaki\t3â€˜51â€œ\r\nTo Be Sure\t2â€˜40â€œ\r\nSun Two\t3â€˜05â€œ\r\nSincerity 3â€˜45â€œ\r\nOf Now\t3â€˜22â€œ\r\nCD 3:\r\n\r\nGeocentric One\t3â€˜43â€œ\r\nUp And Downs\t2â€˜50â€œ\r\nWith Ease 3â€˜14â€œ\r\nThe Gap\t3â€˜17â€œ\r\nThink Again\t3â€˜24â€œ\r\nGeocentric Two\t3â€˜26â€œ\r\nPalmate\t3â€˜32â€œ\r\nWalkabout 2â€˜34â€œ\r\nReconciliation\t3â€˜33â€œ\r\nBranch Lines\t3â€˜24â€œ\r\nHead Games\t2â€˜35â€œ\r\nSplits\t2â€˜32â€œ\r\nConcision\t3â€˜48â€œ\r\nShenanigans 3â€˜10â€œ\r\nMaybe\t5â€˜40â€œ\r\nCD 4:\r\n\r\nAnother Time 3â€˜36â€œ\r\nNo Regrets\t3â€˜12â€œ\r\nAscending\t2â€˜10â€œ\r\nStill Standing 3â€˜20â€œ\r\nThreesome\t2â€˜27â€œ\r\nOf the Moment\t4â€˜30â€œ\r\nReflective Tendencies 4â€˜42â€œ\r\nInevitably 3â€˜19â€œ\r\nSentiments\t3â€˜27â€œ\r\nOpen Question\t4â€˜29â€œ\r\nHidden Knowledge\t4â€˜52â€œ\r\nMeeting\t2â€˜21â€œ\r\nHear Me Out\t6â€˜11â€œ\r\nPassing 3â€˜00â€œ\r\nRoots\t6â€˜04â€œ\r\nCD 5:\r\n\r\nAutograph\t5â€˜02â€œ\r\nDistance\t3â€˜09â€œ\r\nSilhouette\t4â€˜10â€œ\r\nOnly One\t3â€˜10â€œ\r\nThe Fourteenth\t4â€˜10â€œ\r\nThere You Are\t3â€˜54â€œ\r\nEvidently\t2â€˜44â€œ\r\nRelated\t4â€˜34â€œ\r\nMoving\t3â€˜47â€œ\r\nEquanimity\t3â€˜47â€œ\r\nStopped\t2â€˜52â€œ\r\nReversal\t5â€˜59â€œ\r\nThinking of Midnight\t4â€˜42â€œ?\r\nCD 6:\r\n\r\nDark On Light\t11â€˜04â€œ\r\nSet Aside\t10â€˜00â€œ\r\nLongevitine\t11â€˜19â€œ\r\nMove On\t9â€˜22â€œ\r\nComposure\t11â€˜08â€œ\r\nNoBusiness Records NBCD 21-26, 2011.
