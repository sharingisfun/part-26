From the       :\n : invention of scripts and alphabets to the long-misunderstood talking drums :\n : of Africa, Gleick tells the story of information technologies that changed :\n : the very nature of human consciousness. He provides portraits of the key   :\n : figures contributing to the inexorable development of our modern           :\n : understanding of information: Charles Babbage, the idiosyncratic inventor  :\n : of the first great mechanical computer; Ada Byron, the brilliant and doomed:\n : daughter of the poet, who became the first true programmer; pivotal figures:\n : like Samuel Morse and Alan Turing; and Claude Shannon, the creator of      :\n : information theory itself.                                                 :\n :                                                                            :\n : And then the information age arrives. Citizens of this world become experts:\n : willy-nilly: aficionados of bits and bytes. And we sometimes feel we are   :\n : drowning, swept by a deluge of signs and signals, news and images, blogs   :\n : and tweets. The Information is the story of how we got here and where we   :\n : are heading.                                                               :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a29c20f91b008031d3e9b2ade92c5d160a3ddbbf","amp;dn":"James+Gleick+The+Information+2011+Retail+EPUB+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a29c20f91b008031d3e9b2ade92c5d160a3ddbbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,156,32,249,27,0,128,49,211,233,178,173,233,44,93,22,10,61,219,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
