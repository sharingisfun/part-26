The photographer can then use the free Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) editor in Photoshop or Elements to process and â€œdevelopâ€ these Raw files.\r\nThis comprehensive 228-page guide introduces the ACR controls and tools, and shows how to use them to produce photos with greater tonal detail and richer colour. It includes step-by-step, hands-on projects that will help you get to grips with ACR and learn how to get more from all your photos (it even shows you how to use ACR on your JPEGs and TIFFs too).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Photographers Guide to RAW in Photoshop\r\nEnglish | PDF | 228 pages | 44,98 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20b9e1104901afa5e6b903e7ab1e2a7850678cea","amp;dn":"A+Photographers+Guide+to+RAW+in+Photoshop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20b9e1104901afa5e6b903e7ab1e2a7850678cea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,185,225,16,73,1,175,165,230,185,3,231,171,30,42,120,80,103,140,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
