WinRAR is a powerful compression tool with many integrated additional functions to help you organize your compressed archives. It can backup your data and reduce size of email attachments, decompress RAR, ZIP and other files downloaded from Internet and create new archives in RAR and ZIP file format. WinRAR puts you ahead of the crowd when it comes to compression. By consistently creating smaller archives, WinRAR is often faster than the competition. This will save you disc space, transmission costs AND valuable working time as well. WinRAR is ideal for multimedia files. WinRAR automatically recognizes and selects the best compression method. The special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, executables and object libraries particularly well. RAR files can usually compress content by 8 percent to 15 percent more than ZIP files can.\n\n\n----------------------[Features]----------------------\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Using WinRAR puts you ahead of the crowd when it comes to compression by consistently making smaller archives than the competition, saving disk space and transmission costs.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ WinRAR provides complete support for RAR and ZIP archives and is able to unpack CAB, ARJ, LZH, TAR, GZ, ACE, UUE, BZ2, JAR, ISO, 7Z, Z archives.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ WinRAR offers a graphic interactive interface utilizing mouse and menus as well as the command line interface.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ WinRAR is easier to use than many other archivers with the inclusion of a special Ã¢â‚¬Å“WizardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ mode which allows instant access to the basic archiving functions through a simple question and answer procedure.
