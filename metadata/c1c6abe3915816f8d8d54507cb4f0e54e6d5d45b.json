Zoom Player was designed to be simple at first glance while being remarkably dynamic and flexible when used to its full potential. Zoom Player works in two modes.\n\nA Media mode which can play any file supported by DirectShow (any file which plays in MediaPlayer) and a DVD mode which uses pre-installed DirectShow DVD filters to play DVD content.
