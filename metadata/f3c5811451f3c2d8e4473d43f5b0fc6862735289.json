Be aware: the clavichord is a very quiet instrument; the middle section of this disc is meant to sound that soft. These brilliant recordings were released by L'Oiseau-Lyre in 1996.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3c5811451f3c2d8e4473d43f5b0fc6862735289","amp;dn":"Bach%2C+JS+and+Sons+-+Concertos+and+Duets+-+Hogwood%2C+Rousset","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3c5811451f3c2d8e4473d43f5b0fc6862735289","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,197,129,20,81,243,194,216,228,71,61,67,245,176,252,104,98,115,82,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
