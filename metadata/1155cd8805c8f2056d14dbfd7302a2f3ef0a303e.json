By its very nature .NET applications are very easily\ndecompiled.\n\nNone-obfuscated .NET applications can be compared to an\nunlocked car with the keys left in the ignition. If someone\nwants to steal it, it's pretty easy for them to do so.\n\nObfuscated .NET applications are more comparable to a locked\ncar that's kept in a high security car park. It could still be\nstolen but it would take a considerable amount of time, skill\nand effort to do so.\n\nWhy DevExtras .NET Obfusasm?\nDevExtras .NET Obfuscator allows you to protect your assemblies\nby using a variety of advanced obfuscation techniques and is\nvery easy to integrate into your release process. The\nassemblies are obfuscated after compilation as part of the\nbuild process so your development process is completely\nunaffected. Assemblies can be obfuscated either via the GUI or\nthe command line.\n\nI N S T A L L\n\n1) Unpack and install.\n2) Overwrite existing with cracked files.\n3) Enjoy this release\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1155cd8805c8f2056d14dbfd7302a2f3ef0a303e","amp;dn":"DevExtras+Obfusasm+v2.1.7+Lz0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1155cd8805c8f2056d14dbfd7302a2f3ef0a303e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,85,205,136,5,200,242,5,109,20,219,253,115,2,162,243,239,10,48,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
