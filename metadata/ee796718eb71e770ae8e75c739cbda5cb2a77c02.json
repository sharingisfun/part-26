Why would you want to give something likethis to a bunch of ignorant and ungrateful leech monkeys\nwho just grab stuff for the sake of it, and not because they\nappreciate or have any love for the music that means so much\nyou????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\nHow proud would you feel if you wanted to show off your\nfantastic collection of uber rare UK Old Skool to someone,\nonly for them to turn around and say.. That shit&amp;#039;s two a\npenny all over the net\n\nSo....\n\nHold it Down People - Keep it tight!!!!\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nI&amp;#039;ve no problem with people, reseeding this torrent back\nto Oink (check that it&amp;#039;s no longer on the tracker first)\n\nBUT - please have the common courtesy to just send me a\nquick PM first, and let me know (it&amp;#039;s for the best, coz\ni may be in the process of sticking up an updated version\nmyself - innit)\n\nFirstborn @ Oink\n\n\n\n\nMany thanx for your co-operation - [Def-Ade]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee796718eb71e770ae8e75c739cbda5cb2a77c02","amp;dn":"Old+Skool+DNB+-+Oink","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee796718eb71e770ae8e75c739cbda5cb2a77c02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,121,103,24,235,113,231,112,174,142,117,199,57,203,218,92,178,167,124,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
