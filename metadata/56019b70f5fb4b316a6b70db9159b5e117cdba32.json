It's more folksy than her second, No Mermaid.  This is the issue with 13 tracks.  \n\nThe disc was ripped using EAC.  The copy and test CRCs match but the EAC report says the tracks could not be verified as being accurate in the database.  &quot;You might have a different pressing.&quot;  ???  Anyway, it sounds fine.  Log, cue and \nscans are included.\n\nFor more information on FLAC:\n\nblowfish.be/eac/\nteqnilogik.com/tutorials/eac.shtml\ndbpoweramp.com\nexactaudiocopy.de\n\n\nArtist: Sinead Lohan\nTitle: Who Do You Think I Am\n==========================================\n01 - Sinead Lohan - Bee In The Bottle\n02 - Sinead Lohan - You're In My Love\n03 - Sinead Lohan - Sailing By\n04 - Sinead Lohan - She's Lazy\n05 - Sinead Lohan - This Time The Difference Is\n06 - Sinead Lohan - Come Let Me Out\n07 - Sinead Lohan - Send Me A River\n08 - Sinead Lohan - Down On My Luck\n09 - Sinead Lohan - If I Go\n10 - Sinead Lohan - Clearly Undefined\n11 - Sinead Lohan - Water To The Well\n12 - Sinead Lohan - Wo Do You Think I Am\n13 - Sinead Lohan - Did I Do The Right Thing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56019b70f5fb4b316a6b70db9159b5e117cdba32","amp;dn":"Sinead+Lohan++-+Who+Do+You+Think+I+Am+-+1995++-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56019b70f5fb4b316a6b70db9159b5e117cdba32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,1,155,112,245,251,75,49,106,107,112,219,145,89,181,225,23,205,186,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
