Composer James Michael Dooley has been a member of Media Ventures since 1999.\n\nHe has collaborated with composer Hans Zimmer both as his Chief Technical Engineer and as a composer. He has collaborated on scores such as THE TIME MACHINE, HANNIBAL, BLACK HAWK DOWN, MATCHSTICK MEN, SPIRIT: STALLION OF THE CIMARRON, THE RING, TEARS OF THE SUN, THUNDERBIRDS, SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE, KING ARTHUR and MADAGASCAR and has written music for short films as well as many theatrical trailers.
