You can use songs from Soundcloud or get Leaderboards, but you can't upload your score or use Steam Workshop (workaround - read below)\n\nQ: How to change my name? I don't want to be just &quot;Player&quot;!\nA: Open LumaEmu.ini and edit first two rows with &quot;Player&quot; (I don't know which one exactly, TBH).\n\nQ: You mentioned something about mods...\nA: Use steamworkshopdownloader (it ends with com) (I think I cannot post links, so this is a bypass...). You'll find out how to use it then.\n\nEnjoy, and Ride your music!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:850c53386d74264d01b68d5e9e989b7fc2138322","amp;dn":"Audiosurf+2+%28September+19th+Update%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"850c53386d74264d01b68d5e9e989b7fc2138322","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,12,83,56,109,116,38,77,1,182,141,94,158,152,155,127,194,19,131,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
