In the small Colorado town of South Park, good-natured Stan Marsh, slightly neurotic Kyle Broflovski, fat and petulant Eric Cartman, and perpetually doomed Kenny McCormick are psyched for the premiere of the first feature film from flatulent Canadian TV performers Terrance and Phillip, entitled \\&quot;Asses of Fire.\\&quot; The movie is rated R, but that\\'s not about to stop the boys from sneaking into the theater. However, when the boys\\' language gets bluer by the minute after seeing the film, their parents and school administrators decide that something must be done. Kyle\\'s mother comes up with the ideal solution: blame Canada. Terrance and Phillip end up in jail for corrupting America\\'s youth, while the Canadian Air Force retaliates with an air strike targeting the Baldwin brothers. The boys soon organize a children\\'s underground resistance force to free Terrance and Phillip before they can be executed; meanwhile, in a sensitive subplot exploring relationship issues, we\\'re permitted an inside look at the domestic problems of Satan and his lover, Saddam Hussein. As on the TV show, Parker and Stone perform the voices of most of the characters, and they also wrote several songs for the film; George Clooney, Minnie Driver, Eric Idle, Dave Foley, and Mike Judge contribute voices. Not to spoil the plot, but rumor has it that Kenny dies. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 21 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 720\n\nFrame Height: 400\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ea446e60405be334f4c9a93ee9a7977fce00055","amp;dn":"South+Park%3A+Bigger%2C+Longer%2C+%26amp%3B+Uncut%281999%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DRO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ea446e60405be334f4c9a93ee9a7977fce00055","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,164,70,230,4,5,190,51,79,76,154,147,238,154,121,119,252,224,0,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
