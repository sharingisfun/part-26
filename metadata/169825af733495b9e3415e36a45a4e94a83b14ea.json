Sorry for the low video quality but it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s all I could find for this rare FanEdit. With that said keep in mind it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s very watchable. This is an amazing movie. I hope it gets you into the Matrix again. If not I hope you know someone that will appreciate the work CBB has done here.\n\n\n\na TRUE FANEDIT by CBB\n\nThis combines Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions to one improved movie, leaving out all scenes on and about Zion. A worthy sequel to a masterpiece.\n\n\nOriginal film name The Matrix Reloaded\nThe Matrix Revolutions\nFilm studio name Warner Bros\nFilm release date 2003\nOriginal runtime 138 minutes (Reloaded)\n129 minutes (Revolutions)\nFanedit release date June 2005\nNew runtime 143 minutes\nAmount of time cut/added 120 minutes cut / 1 minute added from THE MATRIX\n\nINTENTION:\nAfter the fantastic movie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe MatrixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ everyone was awaiting the sequels, but somehow the writer/directors were not able to continue the epic they started in the way they began. In our humble opinion they lost themselves in detail, wanted to much and definetly to show off with effect orgies. We tried to continue the Matrix withing the Matrix wherever possible. Leaving out the Zion scenes was a major improvement of pace and plot development and the most interesting thing about it is that these scenes are not missed when left out. We tried to be smart and reduced the Matrix sequels to the max. Also we cut out several scenes that just did not feel right or felt to be unnecessary, e.G. when Morpheus talks to Link about trust, it just feels wrong and Morpheus seems to become a stereotype of himself. When Trinity dies on the rooftop and is saved by Neo with an inside heart massage, it just is to much to take (at least for the men in our group). The ending scene that most people criticised about Revolutions becomes reat, when the Zion battle is just not fought.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:169825af733495b9e3415e36a45a4e94a83b14ea","amp;dn":"The+Matrix+Dezionized+%28fan+edit%29+%5B2007%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"169825af733495b9e3415e36a45a4e94a83b14ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,152,37,175,115,52,149,185,227,65,94,54,164,90,78,148,168,59,20,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
