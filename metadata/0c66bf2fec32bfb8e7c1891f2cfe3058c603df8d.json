They were a folk band, and a pretty damn good one at that. I\\\\\\'m very sure they would have achieved mainstream success if they\\\\\\'d kept at it, but the band split up for various reasons.\n\nThe band released one album before they split up. One thousand copies were printed, and all the copies were promptly sold, save for a few kept by the band members. However due to the band breaking up, no more copies were printed, and the album faded into obscurity. This is a torrent of that album (minus a couple of songs). This album is really good. You might even like it if you\\\\\\'ve never liked a folk song before in your life. It\\\\\\'s one of those rare gems that failed to reach broad exposure, not because of lack of quality, but because of all the other reasons good things fail to get noticed.\n\nAll but two tracks are included in this torrent. Those tracks can\\\\\\'t be included because of copyright reasons. That\\\\\\'s too bad, because they are pretty good tracks. I guess if someone else were to upload another torrent with those tracks included, there would be nothing I could do about it...\n\nIf you\\\\\\'d like to buy the album to get the full package, it can be purchased at the link below. You can pay as little as a dollar, or as much as fifty dollars, depending on how much you like the music. When you buy the album, you get all the songs, in both MP3 and FLAC format. The FLAC files are extremely nice by the way. They are 96000Hz, which is a quality level you rarely get to enjoy music at. If you like the music, but don\\\\\\'t want to pay, that\\\\\\'s ok too. At least consider giving the album a like or +1 though, as good things deserved to be shared.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.flyingrabbitmusic.com/Ordering.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.flyingrabbitmusic.com/Ordering.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c66bf2fec32bfb8e7c1891f2cfe3058c603df8d","amp;dn":"Maple+River+Band+-+Go+For+It%21+%5B1980%5D+%5BMP3+V0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c66bf2fec32bfb8e7c1891f2cfe3058c603df8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,102,191,47,236,50,191,184,231,193,137,31,44,254,48,88,198,3,223,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
