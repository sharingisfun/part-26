A CD version of the album was released on 5 January 2009.\n\nContinuing from the first album in the series, part II is equally ambient (as opposed to the more breakbeat led material of their albums and archive series), but features strings, choir sounds and synthesiers, in contrast to the more abstract, sample-based nature of the original album. There are a few low-fi type tracks with subtle beats, similar in sound to tracks from Aphex TwinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSelected Ambient WorksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ series. The strings mentioned are Goldenthalian in sound and weave into the electronic ambience. The album features contributions by Max Richter, Daniel Pemberton, Chris Margory, Robert Fripp, Colin Bell and Will White.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8f37e2e79c86f5912b15cdd60bc8ae250d05bf9","amp;dn":"FSOL+-+Environments+II+%282009%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8f37e2e79c86f5912b15cdd60bc8ae250d05bf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,243,126,46,121,200,111,89,18,177,92,221,96,188,138,226,80,208,91,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
