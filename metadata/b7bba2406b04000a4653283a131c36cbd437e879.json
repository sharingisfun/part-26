In the 90-s itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the most tour Omsk rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“group, one of the most professional &amp; popular in the city, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also in success out of the city limits.\n\nIt has got a huge quantity of prizes &amp; reviews in musical magazines &amp; periodical press. During 10 years group recorded some studio &amp; concert albums, some clips, it gave countless lively concerts, even with such Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«monstersÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» as NAZARETH.\n\nHard -rock was the basis of SUNRISE, which varied and turned out into art- rock.\n\nMay be it was connected with the periodical change of staff. The musicians changed, but the pivot of group, its leader-author, virtuoso guitar player &amp; vocalist Max Bushin was always invariable. Thanks to his talent in 1994 group SUNRISE was given the name of Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«Folk bodyÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â».\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a phenomenon in Russia regarding Anglo-language rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“group.\n\nIt seemed all the ways were open. Producer Valentine Vyatkin, talented TV conductor,\n\nrescued &amp; supported this group in the most difficult moments of their lives, he organized concerts &amp; tours , recordings &amp; interviews. But unfortunately, this tale was with a tragically end. In the night from 1 to 2 July 2001 leader Max Bushin stepped in the window from the 5th floor. It was the bold point in groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s history.\n\nIn spite of all the phenomena SUNRISE didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t come out the world scene. May be, they were born not in the very time &amp; place, but nothing can be returned. SUNRISE remained the legend of Russian underground forever... \n\nLinks: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://vkontakte.ru/club9064744&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://vkontakte.ru/club9064744&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://patefonskver.ru/partyphone2/sunrise.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://patefonskver.ru/partyphone2/sunrise.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\ne-mail: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;81f2f4eff3e8f2e4ecf4f2e8e2e3e0efe5c1e6ece0e8edafe2eeec&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7bba2406b04000a4653283a131c36cbd437e879","amp;dn":"SUNRISE+-+Mathematics+of+Harmony+%5B1996%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7bba2406b04000a4653283a131c36cbd437e879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,187,162,64,107,4,0,10,70,83,40,58,19,28,54,203,212,55,232,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
