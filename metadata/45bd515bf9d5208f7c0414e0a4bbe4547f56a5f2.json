Frank Baum Story is a 1990 film that stars John Ritter as Lyman Frank Baum, the man who wrote The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and thirteen of the other Oz books. Also starring in this TV movie was Annette O'Toole as Baum's supportive wife Maud, and Rue McClanahan who played Baum's tough mother-in-law, Matilda Gage. John's son, Jason Ritter makes his debut in this telefilm as Harry Neal Baum.\n\nThe film depicts how L. Frank Baum came to create one of the best loved fairy tales of all time, while undergoing professional and personal failures.\n\n\n\n\n***NOTE*** This copy is ripped from YouTube... it's the only copy I could find.  \n\nI remember watching this movie at Christmas time when I was 10 years old.  I was obsessed with the Wizard of Oz, and must have watched this TV movie dozens of times.  It's very entertaining and very informative about the creation of the novel that has since become our Nation's first true American fairy tale.  I still enjoy watching this so much, and hopefully you will all enjoy it as well!  Happy Holidays!  :) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45bd515bf9d5208f7c0414e0a4bbe4547f56a5f2","amp;dn":"The.Dreamer.Of.Oz.The.L.Frank.Baum.Story.John.Ritter.1990.WEBTVR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45bd515bf9d5208f7c0414e0a4bbe4547f56a5f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,189,81,91,249,213,32,143,124,4,20,224,164,187,228,84,127,86,165,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
