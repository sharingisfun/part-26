Always somewhat of a joke, the quartet did manage to release a self-titled album of cover songs that they had recorded in 1987 with leftover studio time. Loose and spirited, the group tackles a range of off-the-cuff covers that could be throwaways but for the sheer talent and charm of the players. Indeed, their spirited rendition of PrinceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rasberry BeretÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ even made the charts in 1990. A pair of Robert Johnson-penned blues classics and Muddy WatersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mannish BoyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are attempted with similar aplomb.
