Includes the ISOs of each disk, burn or mount.\n\nA great story from Southpeak Interactive, this futuristic adventure sets in a mining planet called Luna Crysta.  You play the role of Jack Wright who came to this planet to search for the reason behind his uncle\\'s death.  As the intro scene opens, we see a man running from something unknown, but definitely alien.  However, as there was no escape as a solution, he blew himself up.  As the story starts, it appears that was your uncle Jacob, after which you\\'re named Jake, and apparently, he left everything to you.  He was one of the main ore mining owners, even though some say what he has is worthless.  But you don\\'t just believe in that \\'suicide\\' story, so you take a shuttle on Luna Crysta in order to solve the mystery, and try to uncover the truth; why he was killed, and what was so important that he found/discovered and was killed for.\n\nIncludes a patch to install the game on 64 bit copies of Windows; confirmed to work on Windows 7.  Run xp_fix.exe with administrative privileges and in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3.\n\nText patch (REQUIRED FOR MOST COMPUTERS including ANY system newer than Win98):\nOpen the folder where you installed the game, then open \\'bin\\' folder and put riched32.dll in there.  For example, if the path to the installed game is \\'C:\\\\Program Files\\\\SouthPeak Interactive\\\\DSOM\\', you should put riched32.dll in the folder \\'C:\\\\Program Files\\\\SouthPeak Interactive\\\\DSOM\\\\bin\\'\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.justadventure.com/Walkthroughs/Crash4Ever/PRESENT/darkside/darkside.shtm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.justadventure.com/Walkthroughs/Crash4Ever/PRESENT/darkside/darkside.shtm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWalkthrough for those who are new to the game.
