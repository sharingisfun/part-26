A man of simple needs whose greatest ambition is to one day own his own rickshaw, Xiangzi is nonetheless thwarted, time and again, in his attempts to improve his lot in life.\n\nOne of the most important and popular works of twentieth-century Chinese literature, Rickshaw Boy is an unflinchingly honest, darkly comic look at a life on the margins of society and a searing indictment of the philosophy of individualism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f33bad2d2612a152686cffb5aee41b2a0aa0024","amp;dn":"Rickshaw+Boy+-+Lao+She","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f33bad2d2612a152686cffb5aee41b2a0aa0024","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,51,186,210,210,97,42,21,38,134,207,251,90,238,65,178,160,170,0,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
