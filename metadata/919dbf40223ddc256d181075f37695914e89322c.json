Have you ever wondered what a knot looks like rotated 40Ã‚Â° or maybe 90Ã‚Â°? Or maybe you want to see what a Trilene knot or Constrictor knot looks like from the back? Use your finger to spin the knot and see how it looks from any angle in 3D! \n\n Choose from 63 knots and see how they're tied in incredible detail. Watch the knot draw itself or use your finger to tie and untie the knot. Its easy to see where the virtual rope goes in and out and around. (Something about a rabbit and a hole and a tree right? ) Zoom in on the knot to get a closer look or flip it around for another perspective. Can your old school knot app do that?!\n\n Product Features and Functions\n - Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch (Universal App)\n - Learn to tie 63 different knots\n - Browse knots by category or classification\n - Watch knots tie themselves and pause the animation at any time\n - Rotate knots 360 degrees to view them from any angle\n - Zoom in on a knot to see it in greater detail\n - Interact with the knot on screen via mult-touch gestures such as pinch-to-zoom and swipe to tie/untie.\n\n Each 3D knot has detailed reference information including tying pointers, strength and reliability, structural info, and Ashley reference numbers (ABoK) and occasionally the history behind the knot.\n\n The knots are arranged by both Category (Boating, Climbing, Fishing, Scouting, etc) and Class (Bend, Loop, Stopper, etc). If you find a knot you like or want to come back to later, add it to your Favorites list for quick reference.\n\n 3D KNOTS\n ------------------\n Albright Special, Anchor Hitch, AshleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bend, Blood Knot, Bow Knot, Bowline, Bowline on a Bight, Buntline Hitch, Carrick Bend, Cats Paw, Clinch Knot (Improved), Clove Hitch, Constrictor Knot, Cow Hitch/Larks Head Hitch, Double Overhand Knot, Double Sheet Bend, Figure 8 Knot, Figure 8 Bend, Figure 8 Loop, FishermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Eye, FishermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Knot, Granny Knot, Grief Knot, Jar Sling Knot (Spanish Hackamore), Lanyard Hitch, Lariat Loop, Loop Knot, Overhand Knot, Perfection Loop, Rolling Hitch, Round Turn &amp; Two Half Hitches, Running Bowline, Running Knot (Slip Knot), Square Knot (Reef Knot), Sheepshank, Sheet Bend, StevedoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Knot, SurgeonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Knot, SurgeonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Loop, Taut Line Hitch, TillerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hitch, Timber Hitch, Thief Knot, Trilene Knot, Two Half Hitches, Uni Knot, Uni-to-Uni Knot, Water Knot, Zeppelin Bend, Alpine Butterfly, Trucker's Hitch, Prusik Hitch, Palomar Knot, Arbor Knot, Ashley Stopper, Crown Knot, Backsplice, Double Bowline, Fireman's Chair, Handcuff Knot, Icicle Hitch, Water Bowline","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:919dbf40223ddc256d181075f37695914e89322c","amp;dn":"Knots+3D+v2.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"919dbf40223ddc256d181075f37695914e89322c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,157,191,64,34,61,220,37,109,24,16,117,243,118,149,145,78,137,50,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
