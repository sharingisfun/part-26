Often, we feel victimized. We become hurt, angry, and defensive. We end up seeing others as enemies, and when things donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go our way, we become enemies to ourselves.\n     But what if we could move past this pain, anger, and defensiveness?\n     Inspired by Buddhist philosophy, this book introduces us to the four kinds of enemies we encounter in life: the outer enemy, people, institutions, and situations that mean to harm us; the inner enemy, anger, hatred, fear, and other destructive emotions; the secret enemy, self-obsession that isolates us from others; and the super-secret enemy, deep-seated self-loathing that prevents us from finding inner freedom and true happiness.\n     In this practical guide, we learn not only how to identify our enemies, but more important, how to transform our relationship to them. Love Your Enemies teaches us how to . . .\nbreak free from the mode of Ã¢â‚¬Å“usÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ versus Ã¢â‚¬Å“themÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ thinking\n \ndevelop compassion, patience, and love\n \naccept what is beyond our control\n \nembrace lovingkindness, right speech, and other core concepts\n \n     Throughout, authors Sharon Salzberg and Robert Thurman share stories and exercises for achieving finding peace within yourself and with the world. Drawing from ancient spiritual wisdom and modern psychology, Love Your Enemies presents tools that are useful for all readers.\n\nHardcover: 216 pages\nPublisher: Hay House (October 1, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1401928145\nISBN-13: 978-1401928148","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e23c966622423201a15b0b50014be27940a4cb7d","amp;dn":"Love+Your+Enemies+by+Salzberg+and+Thurman.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e23c966622423201a15b0b50014be27940a4cb7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,60,150,102,34,66,50,1,161,91,11,80,1,75,226,121,64,164,203,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
