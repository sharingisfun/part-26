It's the year 1921, and renowned English explorer William Pike leads an expedition into the dense jungles of Peru in search of the fabled &quot;Lost Temple of the Incas,&quot; an elusive sanctuary said to have strange healing properties. Can it be that these two disparate souls, separated by thousands of years and hundreds of millions of miles, will somehow fall in love?\n\n[b]* Note from the scanner:[/b] This issue was printed as a flip book, with the second feature flipped upside down and starting from the end of the book. For this reason, it was released in two formats:\nOriginal Format: Preserves the order and rotation of the book as it was printed.\nReading Format: Has the second feature flipped and ordered after the first feature to make it possible to read.\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
