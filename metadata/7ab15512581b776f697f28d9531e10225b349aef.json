WonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t they both fall into a ditch?&quot; (Luke 6.39).\n The truth which the Church believes is an indivisible whole.\n It is the complete.\nFrom this complete the heretics extracts some suggestions and trying this partial to heighten in the &quot;universal&quot;.\nTheir half-truth, thus becomes one big lie, since turning against the complete truth. \nF.e. the sentence:&quot;Jesus Christ is man&quot; is correct, but it becomes a lie when it is made:\n &quot;Jesus Christ is only a man,because now it is turned against the truth that Jesus Christ is God and man.\n&quot;So,anyone who hates lies should hate heresies too. And anyone who loves truth should be faithful and conscientious member of the Church in which salvation is only by the Orthodox doctrine and grace of the Holy Mysteries.\n\n\nTHE IDENTITY OF WITNESSES OF JEHOVAH\nIn 1881,has been formed the company Tract &quot;Watchtower&quot; and in 1884 was recognized as a corporation by the laws of Pennsylvania under the name &quot;Tract Watchtower Society of Zion&quot;. \nFounder of the company and association was the dealer Charles Russel son of merchant's Taze Russel.At times,the company changed names, some of which are:\n\nBible Students,\nRusselites,\nBible Planners, \nChiliasts,\nSpiritual Israel, \nJehovah's Witnesses,\nChristians Jehovah's Witnesses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab15512581b776f697f28d9531e10225b349aef","amp;dn":"JEHOVAH%27S+WITNESSES+BELIEFS+AND+HOW+DOES+THEIR+FALSEHOOD+ARE+CAN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab15512581b776f697f28d9531e10225b349aef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,177,85,18,88,27,119,111,105,127,40,217,83,30,16,34,91,52,154,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
