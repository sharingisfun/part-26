Adding to this notion is the lyrical fascination with cars. With this in mind, it&amp;#039;s no small wonder that the Oxford, London-based Swervedriver found a home on even the most Anglophobic turntables in the States. Through loads of effects pedals and buried vocals, the band was initially lumped in with the shoegaze scene. But with a heavier aesthetic caused by their love for the above-mentioned bands, as well as the likes of the well-named Loop and Spacemen 3, they were unique -- even with their earliest material. Oddly, Raise only contains six new songs for those who bought their excellent trio of preceding singles. The new tracks rival their greatness. Jimmy Hartridge&amp;#039;s and Adam Franklin&amp;#039;s guitars definitely carry a soaring, seering quality, but the record is largely bass driven, thanks to Adi Vines&amp;#039; thick lines (see &quot;Pile Up&quot; and &quot;Sunset&quot; for the best examples). And though buried to the point of serving merely as another instrument, Franklin&amp;#039;s vocals sound like that of a road trip lifer, made weary by constant sun exposure on the eyes. Other than what might seem as the band trying too hard to prove themselves through complexity, there aren&amp;#039;t many faults to be found. Though it does seem to favor texture over anything else, the somewhat murky production suits the songs well. It actually sounds dark, like green-skied, pre-tornado weather. It&amp;#039;s not too hard to pick apart each instrument on each song, but they still sound a bit mashed together. A fantastic debut that merely hinted at the band&amp;#039;s talents.&quot; -AMG\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nSci-Flyer\nPile-Up\nSon of Mustang Ford\nDeep Seat\nRave Down\nSunset\nFeel So Real\nSandblasted\nLead Me Where You Dare...\n\nEnjoy GOOD music!\n/dUCK","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ab0a7a1e5143c95cf18fa8e6d14771ba65216cb","amp;dn":"Indie+Classic%21%3A+Swervedriver+-+Raise+%5B1991%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ab0a7a1e5143c95cf18fa8e6d14771ba65216cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,176,167,161,229,20,60,149,207,24,250,142,109,20,119,27,166,82,22,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
