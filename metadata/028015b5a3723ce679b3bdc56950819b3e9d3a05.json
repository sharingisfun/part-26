After the 7th inning stretch, the sun goes down, and the dysfunctional teammates find themselves fighting for their lives against a town of flesh-eating monsters! Now, it's up to coach Casey Sullivan to help his team escape from being the next dish in the town's terrifying feeding frenzy! Eisner &amp; Harvey Award-winning graphic novel author Mark Andrew Smith joins forces with Eisner nominated illustrator James Stokoe for a gripping roller coaster of a graphic novel, packed with shocks, gore, and screamingly outrageous humor, when America's Favorite Past Time becomes one team's ultimate nightmare!&quot; This fills a request from KAT. Thanks to Minutemen-InnerDemons for this awesome Digital copy, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:028015b5a3723ce679b3bdc56950819b3e9d3a05","amp;dn":"Sullivan%27s+Sluggers+%282012%29+%28Digital%29+%28Minutemen-ID%29+%5BREQ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"028015b5a3723ce679b3bdc56950819b3e9d3a05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,128,21,181,163,114,60,230,121,179,189,197,105,80,129,155,62,157,58,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
