This up-to-date, hands-on simulation shows students how to identify and match personal skills with job interests, prepare a resume and keep it updated, and research jobs and companies using the Internet and other sources. The simulation begins with a fun and helpful self-assessment, which students then use to research and explore suitable career options. For additional support, the kit reviews the employment process, provides worksheets and advice to boost students' confidence when pursuing employment, and outlines a graceful way to leave a job. An updated RESUME GENERATOR CD, included with each simulation, helps students easily prepare personalized, professional resumes and other employment documents, which they can organize and store in a provided resume cover and employment portfolio. Students can also use the CD to create a personal profile for the job search or review numerous sample employment documents, including resumes and cover letters with correct content and formatting. In addition, the CD includes helpful tips on how to develop a winning resume, what type of cover letter to use and when, action words that sell, and other employment documents to help ease the job search process.\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b871e020d440af9938e0809b2d2adbe295a632fe","amp;dn":"Getting+a+Job+Process+Kit%2C+6+edition-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b871e020d440af9938e0809b2d2adbe295a632fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,113,224,32,212,64,175,153,56,224,128,155,45,42,219,226,149,166,50,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
