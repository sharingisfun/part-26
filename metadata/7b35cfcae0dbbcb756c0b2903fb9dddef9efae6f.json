Book sales then surpassed Gone with the Wind, following the release of the highly successful 1959 MGM film adaptation; the film winning eleven Academy Awards. [1] The book was the first work of fiction to be blessed by a Pope, receiving benediction from Pope Leo XIII . [2] The name &quot;Ben Hur&quot; derives from the Hebrew for &quot;Son of white linen&quot;\n\n\n\nCast:\nJamie Glover\nSamuel West\nNarrated by Michael Gambon\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Hur:_A_Tale_of_the_Christ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Hur:_A_Tale_of_the_Christ&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nLew Wallace's - Ben Hur - 01 of 04 - A Friendship Betrayed\nLew Wallace's - Ben Hur - 02 of 04 - Son Of Arrius\nLew Wallace's - Ben Hur - 03 of 04 - The Chariot Race\nLew Wallace's - Ben Hur - 04 of 04 - The King Comes Into His Kingdom\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration : 55mn 1s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[b]\nA number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.\nI have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice\nI was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them.\n\nThere is little point in downloading a &quot;Torrent&quot; and then recreating a &quot;Torrent&quot; using the same files.\n\nThe fact there was a torrent for you to download is clear you don't need to use the files to make another exactly the same version,\n\nAll you will do is split seeders over 2 torrents with the &quot;same&quot; files and make both have less seeders.\n\n\n[/b]\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b35cfcae0dbbcb756c0b2903fb9dddef9efae6f","amp;dn":"Lew+Wallace%5C%27s+-+Ben+Hur+-+Audio+Drama+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b35cfcae0dbbcb756c0b2903fb9dddef9efae6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,53,207,202,224,219,188,183,86,192,178,144,63,185,221,222,249,239,174,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
