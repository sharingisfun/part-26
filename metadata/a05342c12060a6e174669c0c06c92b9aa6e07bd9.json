He also wrote a great deal of chamber and sacred music. Rubbra's works went into eclipse in the 60s and 70s, as the BBC management pushed British serialists to garner musical attention abroad, but he lived long enough to see the critical tide reverse itself, and respect return for at least some of his life's work.\r\n\r\nHis Eighth Symphony marked his first return to the form after a decade. Simple intervalic motifs become more prevalent, though he uses one, like a grim, giant clock, to excellent advantage throughout.\r\n\r\nTwo bios enclosed.\r\n\r\nYou can find my classical uploads by searching on Philidor, or checking this thread:\r\n \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Philidor-s-uploads--63895","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a05342c12060a6e174669c0c06c92b9aa6e07bd9","amp;dn":"Rubbra+-+Sym+%238+-+R+Hickox%2C+BBC+Nat+O+of+Wales+%281999%29+%5BPhilidor%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a05342c12060a6e174669c0c06c92b9aa6e07bd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,83,66,193,32,96,166,225,116,102,156,12,6,201,43,154,166,224,123,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
