In their last meeting, Vincent Kompany scored the only goal against United at the Etihad Stadium to give City a decisive advantage in the title race with only two games remaining. City boast a phenomenal home record under manager Roberto Mancini, but United can take heart from the fact they have won more than half of their Premier League visits to their neighbours.\n\nIn the day's other games, Everton host a Tottenham side aiming for a first win at Goodison Park in six seasons, and different footballing philosophies collide at Upton Park as Sam Allardyce's West Ham meet Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:125b39d62e85bbe04e8b48e97e6fb0e6fc5d9fec","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+Two+09.12.2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"125b39d62e85bbe04e8b48e97e6fb0e6fc5d9fec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,91,57,214,46,133,187,224,78,139,72,233,126,111,176,230,252,93,159,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
