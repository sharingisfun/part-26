The i* framework conceives of software-based information systems as being situated in environments in which social actors relate to each other in terms of goals to be achieved, tasks to be performed, and resources to be furnished. The book includes Eric Yu's original proposal for the i* framework as well as research that applies, adapts, extends, or evaluates the social modeling concepts and approach.&quot;\nChapter 2 is a reprint of Eric Yu's doctoral dissertation from 1995. It is followed by 18 chapters authored by researchers from around the world who have applied, adapted, or extended the i* framework in various ways, and for diverse application contexts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from business processes to knowledge management to air traffic control, from information security to software development.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39b6d78966917f21a48fabe26fccf86273ac1501","amp;dn":"Social+Modeling+For+Requirements+Engineering+%5Bi+%2A%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39b6d78966917f21a48fabe26fccf86273ac1501","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,182,215,137,102,145,127,33,164,143,171,226,111,204,248,98,115,172,21,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
