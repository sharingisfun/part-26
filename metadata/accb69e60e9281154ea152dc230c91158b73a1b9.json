How can we help them? Economist Paul Collier lays out a bold, compassionate plan for closing the gap between rich and poor.\n\nPaul Collier studies the political and economic problems of the very poorest countries: 50 societies, many in sub-Saharan Africa, that are stagnating or in decline, and taking a billion people down with them. His book The Bottom Billion identifies the four traps that keep such countries mired in poverty, and outlines ways to help them escape, with a mix of direct aid and external support for internal change.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2003, Collier was the director of the World BankÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Development Research Group; he now directs the Centre for the Study of African Economies at Oxford, where he continues to advise policymakers.\n\n    &quot;Collier sheds much light on how the world should tackle its biggest moral challenge. [He] shows, too, how far western governments and other external actors are from currently giving the sort of help these countries desperately need.&quot;\n\nMartin Wolf, Financial Times\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nplease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\nAre you a British citizen?
