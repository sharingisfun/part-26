The water poured out and washed him on to the track, fracturing his neck nearly to the point of breaking it. This footage appears in the released film. Keaton suffered from blinding migraines for years after making this movie and was unaware of the reason, until a doctor diagnosed him in the 1930s. \n\nBuster Keaton doubled for Ford West, the actor playing Gillette, in the scene where the motorcycle he is driving (with Keaton on the handlebars) hits a deep pothole and bucks him off flat on his behind.\n\nAccording to the book Buster is reading, the seven rules for being a detective are: 1. Search Everybody. 2. Look for Clue. 3. Examine all windows. 4. Search for finger prints. 5. Shadow your man closely. 6. Send for the police. 7. Keep cool. Buster actually only employs rules #1 and #5 in the movie. \n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/bUg8l.png[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/fk8Iu.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/txr1O.png[/IMG]\n\nSherlock Jr (1924) 720p BRrip_sujaidr\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/nZdCe.png[/IMG]\n\n\n[Movie Title ]....[ Sherlock Jr.\n[Release Year ]...[ 1924\n[iMDb Rating ]....[ 8.3/10\n[Genre ]..........[ Comedy | Fantasy\n[Runtime ]........[ 45 min\n[File Size ]......[ 300 MB\n[Resolution ].....[ 972 X 720\n[Language ].......[ Silent [English Score]\n[Subtitle ].......[ None\n[Container ]......[ MatRoska (.mkv)\n\n\nthanks to shan\n\nSAMPLE                  :INCLUDED\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/jHcjQ.png[/IMG]\nuploader\n sujaidr\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/UzVN6.png[/IMG]\n\nPLOT:A projectionist is studying to be a detective and is in love with a young lady.
