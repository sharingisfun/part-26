The show was recorded and mixed to the usual PT standards in order to provide material for a planned live album, but when the decision was taken to film much of the same repertoire in Holland for a major DVD release instead, the Atlanta recording ended up back in the vault. Now PT have now decided to make it available in complete form as a download only release to raise funds for Mick Karn's treatment for cancer. Although the repertoire is similar to that on the Anesthetize DVD, the performance has its own atmosphere, and also includes the first ever officially released live recording of &quot;A Smart Kid&quot;.\n\nThe mp3s are high quality 320kbps files, and there is a break between tracks 8 and 9 in case you want to burn your own 2 CD set, for which Carl Glover has also provided CD artwork.\n\nPlease note that profits from the sale of the Atlanta download will go to Mick Karn and his family.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:063c25be61dbc24705177927be08a7d21b3f8601","amp;dn":"Porcupine+Tree+-+Atlanta+%282010%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"063c25be61dbc24705177927be08a7d21b3f8601","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,60,37,190,97,219,194,71,5,23,121,39,190,8,167,210,27,63,134,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
