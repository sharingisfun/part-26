The story centers on the relationship between a 12-year-old boy, Oskar, and a 200-year-old vampire child, Eli, of indeterminate gender. It takes place in Blackeberg, a working class suburb of Stockholm, in the early '80s. The book focuses on the darker side of humanity, dealing with issues such as bullying, drugs, theft, pedophilia, prostitution and murder as well as the obvious supernatural themes.\n\nThe book was a bestseller in the author's home country of Sweden and has been translated into Danish, German, Russian and English in 2007. A Swedish language film version by the same name, directed by Tomas Alfredson, was released in 2008 to widespread critical acclaim. An English language remake, to be directed by Matt Reeves, is scheduled for release in 2010.\n\n\n*** DIRECTSHOW FILTER LIST ***\n1. Default DirectSound Device\n2. VMR9 - Renderless mode\n3.
