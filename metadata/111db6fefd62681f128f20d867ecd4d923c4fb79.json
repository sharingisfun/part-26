It&amp;#039;s set to use the Vista explorer.exe, but it didn&amp;#039;t work so well in tests I did, so you might want to use Litestep (it has a menu to let you pick the shell).\n\nThis torrent contains a file named VistaPE.ISO. You need a CD burning program, such as Nero, to OPEN this file (not burn to a disc, but OPEN it). If you simply burn this file to a disc, it WILL NOT WORK. You must OPEN the file in a burning program, and THEN burn it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:111db6fefd62681f128f20d867ecd4d923c4fb79","amp;dn":"VistaPE+-+Windows+Vista+Bootable+off+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"111db6fefd62681f128f20d867ecd4d923c4fb79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,29,182,254,253,98,104,31,18,143,32,216,103,236,212,217,35,196,251,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
