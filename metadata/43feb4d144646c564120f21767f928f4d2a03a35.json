The &quot;settings&quot; are those of poets &quot;Ludwig Rellstab&quot; (1799Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1860), &quot;Heinrich Heine&quot; (1797Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1856) and &quot;Johann Gabriel Seidl&quot; (1804Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1875) respectively (and yes, I have no idea what I am talking about!). \n\nAccording to Wikipdia (the source of all this confusion) Schwanengesang was composed in 1828 and published in 1829 just a few months after Schubert's death. The article goes on to explain that the first 13 songs were copied in a single sitting on consecutive pages and in &quot;the standard order&quot; (whatever that might be).\n\nThe song titles (below) were apparently chosen by Schubert as (probably) the majority of the poems were written by Heinrich Heine who did not provide any titles. Whether or not the other poets provided titles is not mentioned in the article. The lack of a 13Ã¡Âµâ€”ÃŠÂ° song is also a mystery. \n\nOne thing that does agree with the Wikipedia article are the titles given to these versions performed here by Valentina Lisitsa: They all have a &quot;(Liszt)&quot; at the end who (meaning &quot;Franz Liszt&quot;), according the the article, transcribed these songs for solo piano. What instrument they were originally composed for is also a mystery.\n\nThe title of the collection was apparently chosen by their publisher: &quot;Tobias Haslinger&quot;.\n\nSee what happens when you die and other people take charge of getting things right? Yes Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ either \n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ don't create anything or\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ at least have the decency to not die before publishing!\n\nSchwanengesang 01-12 (By Franz Schubert, transcribed by: Franz Liszt):\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n#01 Die Stadt (Liszt).avi\n#02 Das Fischermadchen (Liszt).avi\n#03 Aufenthalt (Liszt).avi\n#04 Am Meer (Liszt)\n#05 Abschied (Liszt)\n#06 In der Ferne (Liszt)\n#07 StÃƒÂ¤ndchen (Liszt)\n#08 Ihr Bild (Liszt)\n#09 Fruhlingssehnsucht (Liszt)\n#11 Der Atlas (Liszt)\n#13 Die Taubenpost (Liszt)\n#14 Kriegers Ahnung (Liszt)\n#10 Liebesbotschaft (Liszt)\n#12 Der DoppelgÃƒÂ¤nger (Liszt)\n\nI took these from the versions on YouTube (854x480 or AR=16:9) initially as separate AVI files de-multiplexed from their mp4 originals. However, as per usual, I decided to make some modifications to the audio in the hopes of achieving a better quality by re-encoding YouTube's pitiful &quot;AAC 126 kbps @44.1 KHz&quot; audio to Dolby &quot;192 kbps @ 48 KHz&quot; (both 2 channels).\n\nWell the result was (to me) such a dramatic improvement I figured it's time for another upload. But before doing that I thought I'd try gluing them together. 1-3 worked fine, but 4 wouldn't append due to a slight difference in frame rate and encoding parameters. After much fiddling around I managed to get 1-4 together but since I had to re-encode both audio and video to make that happen, it would be too much work to do that again for the remaining 8 segments. So now there are just two files both approximately of the following quality:\n\nIn a sub-directory called &quot;Sample From Original&quot; I have included the first song &quot;Die Stadt&quot; (English: &quot;The city&quot;) so that anyone interested can hear the difference between what comes out of YouTube and that same data reformatted as Dolby (with volume normalization). It's true, the first is softer, but one can always raise the speaker volume to hear it louder which I did, and there's simply no comparison. The Dolby audio (from the very same source) sounds totally different. In fact, the &quot;scary&quot; mood that the song appears to attempt to describe only *becomes* scary after re-encoding (to me).\n\nVideo Details for part 2:\n-------------------------\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : F.
