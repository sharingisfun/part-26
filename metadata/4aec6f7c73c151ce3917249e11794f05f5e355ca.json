It's a couple of weeks before the big Republican party convention: thousands of people spending cash, which is flowing into a relatively inadequate Brinks warehouse, protected by only three or four armed guards. The robber's plan is to distract the cops by manipulating and alerting them to a possible assassination attempt. Lucas Davenport meanwhile has problems of his own, targeted by a psychopathic pimp, who blames Davenport for the fact he's in a wheelchair. Only it's not Davenport he's going after; it's his innocent daughter, Letty.\n\n\n\nGooD SeeDinG!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4aec6f7c73c151ce3917249e11794f05f5e355ca","amp;dn":"John+Sandford+-+Wicked+Prey+-+Unb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4aec6f7c73c151ce3917249e11794f05f5e355ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,236,111,124,115,193,81,206,57,23,36,158,17,121,79,5,245,227,85,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
