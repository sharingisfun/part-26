This is the official mac version of the game. Hope you enjoy and please help seed.\n\n\n-------------------\n\nRedshirt (1.04 Patch Notes)\n\n\n-- The only remaining reported game-breaking critical bug, which comes \nafter away missions sometimes, where newly generated NPCs don't have \ntheir profile pics saved properly, causing game to freeze. Have added a \nworkaround for this. \n\n-- To address previously-broken games which had this, have added a check \nthat all profile pics exist when starting an existing game. \n\n-- Ensures 'give NPC your extra ticket window' shows NPCs name and \nrelationship with you now. \n\n-- Properly saving after leaving station early. \n\n-- Saving screen resolution settings \n\n-- Ensure 'money' route is triggered before 'bribery' route is \n(Otherwise can lead to confusion). \n\n-- Added an 'endless' game mode! \n\n\n---------------------\n\n\nWhat's cool about it:\n\n- Diligent worker or social schmoozer - it's up to you how to climb the career ladder on board the Megalodon-9!\n\n- Customize your space cadet with a large and varied skillset!\n\n- Use the S.H.O.P. (Self-Help Object Purveyor) and show off that cybernetic kitty or the latest in musical instruments, the XX'TH'X Eight-Armed Mandolin!\n\n\nOverview:\n\nRedshirt is the comedy sci-fi sim about social networking aboard a space station, starring the station's most ambitious low-ranking peon: you!\n\nNavigate the professional and interpersonal politics of the ubiquitous &quot;Spacebook&quot; to curry favor among friends and colleagues. As intense intergalactic conflict rages around you, it's up to you to accrue those all-important &quot;likes&quot; on your status updates!\n\nWhether you're looking for love, opportunities for promotion, or even a chance to play Zero-G golf with the captain, you can schmooze your way through social circles and claw your way up the career ladder. Perhaps you too can finally achieve the dream of an off-station transfer, or even the Redshirt's opportunity of a lifetime: being sent on an away-mission!\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/redshirt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/redshirt&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b7b3d188b45f336878d1d1a7179706bb2850c00","amp;dn":"Redshirt+%28Latest+Version%29+%28Mac%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b7b3d188b45f336878d1d1a7179706bb2850c00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,123,61,24,139,69,243,54,135,141,29,26,113,121,112,107,178,133,12,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
