Hopefully eliminating many prospective players first hurdle to getting into MWLL. \n\nFor more info, Visit http://www.mechlivinglegends.net/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81343a5c6f50363090a47576aca460de27974ffc","amp;dn":"MechWarrior%3A+Living+Legends+0.7.1+Beta+final","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81343a5c6f50363090a47576aca460de27974ffc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,52,58,92,111,80,54,48,144,164,117,118,172,164,96,222,39,151,79,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
