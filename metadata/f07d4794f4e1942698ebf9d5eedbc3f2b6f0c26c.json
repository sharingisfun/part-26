Unfortunately, SkyNet does send another one back - and this one is called the T-X, even more powerful &amp; advanced than the dreaded T-1000. However, another CSM-101 Terminator is also sent back to protect John against the T-X. Now, Skynet is patiently assuming control of civilian computer systems, under the guise of a computer virus. John has also met his future wife, Kate Brewster, whose father - a U.S. Air Force General - is in charge of the military computer systems &amp; is leery of up linking SkyNet. However, when the SkyNet virus infects the U.S military computers &amp; leaves the country open to attack, the machines begin their horrific takeover. Soon a nuclear war will result - and the war against the machines will begin. Can the outdated CSM-101 Terminator eliminate the highly advanced T-X - or will a darker future await man following the nuclear attack?\n\nAudio: English, Czech, Polish.\nSubs.: Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, English, Finnish, Greek, Hebrew,\n       Hindi, Icelandic, Norwegian, Polish, Serbian, Slovenian, Swedish, Turkish.\n\nPlease seed after downloading...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f07d4794f4e1942698ebf9d5eedbc3f2b6f0c26c","amp;dn":"Terminator+3+Rise+of+the+Machines+-+DVDR+PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f07d4794f4e1942698ebf9d5eedbc3f2b6f0c26c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,125,71,148,244,225,148,38,152,235,249,213,238,219,195,242,182,240,194,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
