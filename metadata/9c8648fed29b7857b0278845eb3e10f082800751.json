Rarely, if ever, have so many works from so many different places been brought together &amp; reproduced in color to make one grand, glorious book.&quot; Here you will find paintings by Raphael &amp; Titian, Rembrandt &amp; Frans Hals, El Greco &amp; Valazquez. The Impressionists are represented as are the Modern Age painters and photographs by Dorthea Lange, Ansel Adams, &amp; Edward Weston. There are even cameras. From the natural world come Dinosaur remains, brilliant precious gems, &amp; wildlife exhibits. Milestones in transportation are recorded with such artifacts as the 1903 Wright Flyer (airplane), Henry Ford's first car, &amp; even a Nazi submarine, while Judy Garland's red slippers from The Wizard of Oz, one of Elvis's jumpsuits, &amp; Tony Walton's set model from Death of a Salesman pay tribute to achievements in entertainment. History buffs can peruse such relics as the original Star Spangled Banner, Teddy Roosevelt's rifle, &amp; the chair in which Lincoln was assassinated, while sports fans thrill to Babe Ruth's uniform, bat, &amp; ball, &amp; the bench used by Vince Lombardi. Charles Mathes' informative text takes you inside 80 of the nation's most celebrated museums!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c8648fed29b7857b0278845eb3e10f082800751","amp;dn":"Treasures+of+American+Museums+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c8648fed29b7857b0278845eb3e10f082800751","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,134,72,254,210,155,120,87,176,39,136,69,235,62,16,240,130,128,7,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
