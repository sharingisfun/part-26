Henry-esque tale about a young boy attempting to buy a pair of shoes as a Christmas present for his dying mother would blow up into a massive hit. So overwhelming was the response to that song (it landed atop Billboard's Adult Contemporary Chart) that the group decided to fashion an entire holiday album around it, naturally titling it Christmas Shoes. In addition to the heart-wrenching title track, the contemporary Christian rockers serve up some beautifully arranged versions of cherished favorites such as &quot;Away in the Manger/God Rest Ye, Merry Gentleman,&quot; &quot;The First Noel,&quot; and &quot;What Child Is This,&quot; as well as an impish, rather histrionic version of &quot;You're a Mean One, Mr.Grinch&quot; which should tickle the underage set. Newsong have also written a number of well-crafted, infectious holiday songs that don't bludgeon you with heavy-handed inspirational messages, but instead shine brightly with the true spirit of the holiday.\n\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, May 2009\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b6a4ebd66c9043825eb92d8812fc986cc1adc21","amp;dn":"Newsong+-+2001+-+The+Christmas+Shoes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b6a4ebd66c9043825eb92d8812fc986cc1adc21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,106,78,189,102,201,4,56,37,235,146,216,129,47,201,134,204,26,220,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
