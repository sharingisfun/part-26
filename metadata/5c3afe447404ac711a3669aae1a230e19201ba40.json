They were famous for wearing &quot;space suit&quot; costumes on stage, and for their innovative electronic guitar sound. They have since released 42 albums, selling more than 18 million records, and still tour.\nThe Spotnicks originated from Bo Starander and BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn Thelin's duo &quot;The Rebels&quot; (1956), who later became &quot;Rock-Teddy and The Blue Caps&quot;, a group formed in 1957 in Gothenburg now with guitarist Bo Winberg (born 27 March 1939) in the band as well as Bo Starander (born 11 March 1942) (rhythm guitar), and BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn Thelin (born 27 June 1942) (bass guitar). In 1958 they added Ove Johansson (drums), changed their name to &quot;The Frazers&quot;, and began playing regularly in local clubs. They signed a recording contract in 1961, and changed their name to &quot;The Spotnicks&quot;, a play on the Russian satellite Sputnik as suggested by their\nmanager, Roland Ferneborg. Starander was later known as Bob Lander.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spotnicks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spotnicks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.spotnicks.net/uk/index_uk.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.spotnicks.net/uk/index_uk.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Spotnicks Collection - The Spotnicks\nThis compilation 1992 (original recordings)\n\n01  The Spotnicks Collection - Orange Blossom Special\n02  The Spotnicks Collection - Cape Kennedy\n03  The Spotnicks Collection - Amapola\n04  The Spotnicks Collection - Johnny Guitar\n05  The Spotnicks Collection - Telstar\n06  The Spotnicks Collection - Joey's Song\n07  The Spotnicks Collection - Walking Back to Happiness\n08  The Spotnicks Collection - Space Walk\n09  The Spotnicks Collection - Ghostriders in the Sky\n10  The Spotnicks Collection - Drina (Mars Na Drini)\n11  The Spotnicks Collection - Bach Goes to Sea\n12  The Spotnicks Collection - Diamonds\n13  The Spotnicks Collection - In the Mood\n14  The Spotnicks Collection - I Remember You\n15  The Spotnicks Collection - Anna\n16  The Spotnicks Collection - Old Faithful\n17  The Spotnicks Collection - Havah Nagila\n18  The Spotnicks Collection - One Has My Name\n19  The Spotnicks Collection - Spanish Gypsy Dance\n20  The Spotnicks Collection - If You Could Read My Mind\n21  The Spotnicks Collection - Happy Guitar\n22  The Spotnicks Collection - From Russia With Love\n23  The Spotnicks Collection - Lovesick Blues\n24  The Spotnicks Collection - Valentina (Save the Last Dance)\n25  The Spotnicks Collection - Hey Good Looking\n26  The Spotnicks Collection - Busted\n27  The Spotnicks Collection - Alabamy Bound\n28  The Spotnicks Collection - Karelia\n29  The Spotnicks Collection - Hang On\n30  The Spotnicks Collection - The Spotnicks Theme","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c3afe447404ac711a3669aae1a230e19201ba40","amp;dn":"Spotnicks+-+The+Spotnicks+Collection+%281992%29++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c3afe447404ac711a3669aae1a230e19201ba40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,58,254,68,116,4,172,113,26,54,105,170,225,162,48,225,146,1,186,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
