The Ring of Charon\n\nRoger M. Allen's &quot;Ring of Charon&quot; is great science-fiction. A hence-undiscovered alien race causes the Earth to disappear through a wormhole due to the unauthorized experiments of a gravity scientist, and the remaining off-Earth scientists try to find out what really happened. The story is told brillantly through the eyes of the human scientists, and the strange Charonians who plan to use the Earth for their own ends, which are not good for mankind. The way that the Charonians are Von Neumann creatures is a bit hard to swallow, as is the occasional overload of detail, as well the Naked Purple movement and the K-Crash, but Allen manages to be a master storyteller, and weaves a great story of human survival and the need for curiousity.\n\n2. The Shattered Sphere\n\nAllen combines the ideas of hard science with the delights of a fast-paced action thriller in this spellbinding sequel to The Ring of Charon. Earth has been kidnapped by the Charonians, a race of dangerous aliens. An Adversary powerful enough to terrify the otherwise untouchable Charonians enters the picture. But, can he save the Earth?\n\nRead by John Haag\nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad40de92cc8947050494d22b3673ff3f9c270198","amp;dn":"Roger+MacBride+Allen+-+The+Hunted+Earth+%5B1-2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad40de92cc8947050494d22b3673ff3f9c270198","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,64,222,146,204,137,71,5,4,148,210,43,54,115,255,63,156,39,1,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
