Recorded in two weeks time at a friend's house in Nebraska, The Year of Getting By is a selection of austere alt-country songs.\n\nAn intimate collection of modest, melancholic tracks that are sung either in a brooding baritone or a sorrowful tenor and features straightforward stringwork on the mandolin, dobro, upright bass, acoustic guitar, banjo and sometimes piano. Mostly slow-tempo sad songs, themes of nomadic rambling, struggle and isolation prevail throughout the record starting with opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“Time PassingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which incorporates all the themes and sets the tone. And, again in Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Train, The Drink, and The Dawn,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the themes are present in its dismal and tragic tale unraveling the narrators' heartbreaking circumstances. The stark arrangement and sorrowful vocals in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Western TownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is beautifully dreary while the up-tempo banjo and soaring vocals on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Left My HomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is hopeful.\n\nNothing I could say could do The Year of Getting By justice or adequately describe my admiration for the album and Kill County. All I can say is, there's no bones about it, the bare-bone arrangements and desolate stories make an amazing alt-country album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a581c4863260e656902bd77798e39b849d8a9dce","amp;dn":"Kill+County+-+The+Year+of+Getting+By+%5B2011%5D+%5BFLAC+%2F+WEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a581c4863260e656902bd77798e39b849d8a9dce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,129,196,134,50,96,230,86,144,43,215,119,152,227,155,132,157,138,157,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
