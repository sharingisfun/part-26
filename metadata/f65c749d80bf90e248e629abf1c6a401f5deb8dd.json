Icy figures danced in the wind and gazed through children's windows with soul-chilling eyes. People wandered into the whiteout and were never seen again. Families were torn apart, and the town would never be the same.\n\nNow, as a new storm approaches twelve years later, the folks of Coventry are haunted by the memories of that dreadful blizzard and those who were lost in the snow. Photographer Jake Schapiro mourns his little brother, Isaac, even as---tonight---another little boy is missing. Mechanic and part-time thief Doug Manning's life has been forever scarred by the mysterious death of his wife, Cherie, and now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s starting over with another woman and more ambitious crimes. Police detective Joe Keenan has never been the same since that night, when he failed to save the life of a young boy . . . and the boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father vanished in the storm only feet away. And all the way on the other side of the country, Miri Ristani receives a phone call . . . from a man who died twelve years ago.\n\nAs old ghosts trickle back, this new storm will prove to be even more terrifying than the last.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f65c749d80bf90e248e629abf1c6a401f5deb8dd","amp;dn":"Christopher+Golden+-+Snowblind+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f65c749d80bf90e248e629abf1c6a401f5deb8dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,92,116,157,128,191,144,226,72,230,41,171,241,198,164,1,245,222,184,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
