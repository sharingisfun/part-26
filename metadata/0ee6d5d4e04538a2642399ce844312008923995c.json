In 1968, Texas-born Holly Maddux (Naomi Watts) left home to attend Bryn Mawr College, and two years later she made the acquaintance of Einhorn (Kevin Anderson), a community organizer and activist well known for leading peaceful crusades and as the key figure in Philadelphia's radical community. Holly and Ira became romantically involved, but, despite his public image, behind closed doors Einhorn was often abusive and manipulative, though Holly, for her own reasons, accepted his poor treatment and infidelity. In 1977, Holly had reached the end of her rope and told friends she was leaving Ira, intending to return to their apartment only to collect her belongings. She was not seen again for several months, until her corpse was found stuffed in a trunk in Ira's apartment. Einhorn was arrested in connection with the crime, but was released on bail, only to flee the country, surfacing in France four years later. Convicted 'in absentia' for Holly's murder in 1993, Einhorn was extradited to the United States in 1997 under the condition he receive a new trial. The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer was produced for NBC Television, and was first aired as a two-part miniseries in May 1999.\n\nAlso known as: La caza del unicornio asesino, CaÃƒÂ§a ao UnicÃƒÂ³rnio, Die Jagd nach dem Unicorn-Killer, El asesino del unicornio, Saaliina murhaaja, Tappajan takaa-ajo, Liaison mortelle, VadÃƒÂ¡szat az egyszarvÃƒÂºra, Jakten pÃƒÂ¥ Unicorn Killer, ÃÅ¾Ã‘â€¦ÃÂ¾Ã‘â€šÃÂ° ÃÂ½ÃÂ° ÃÂµÃÂ´ÃÂ¸ÃÂ½ÃÂ¾Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ¾ÃÂ³ÃÂ°-Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ±ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¹Ã‘â€ Ã‘Æ’, Asasinul-unicorn. \nCountry: USA\nStudio: Dan Wigutow Productions, Regency Television\nDuration: 01:22:38 and 01:23:22\n\nFile\nCodec: MPEG-2\nQuality: DVD\nVideo: PAL 4:3 (720x576) VBR ~3663 kbit/s\nAudio #1: English (AC3, 2 ch, 48 KHz, 224 kbps)\nSubtitles #1: Dutch","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ee6d5d4e04538a2642399ce844312008923995c","amp;dn":"The+Hunt+for+the+Unicorn+Killer+1999+DVD+Naomi+Watts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ee6d5d4e04538a2642399ce844312008923995c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,230,213,212,224,69,56,162,100,35,153,206,132,67,18,0,137,35,153,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
