They had some successes, taking Do you love\nme to number one on the UK charts and having other major hits with Twist and\nshout, Candy man and The three bells, but after that Brian Poole decided to go\nsolo. It turned out to be the wrong decision for him and he faded into obscurity,\nbut the remaining Tremeloes went on to bigger and better success, finding a\nnew lead singer but also developing harmonies.\n\nI have never seen a compilation that included the Brian Poole tracks as well as\nthe more famous recordings of the Tremeloes after he left - you have to buy a\ndifferent compilation to get them - but this is the best Tremeloes compilation I\nhave yet seen.\n\nSilence is golden is their most famous song. It was a cover of a Four Seasons\nsong that became a British number one hit and a major American hit, just\nmissing the top ten. Here comes my baby was written by Cat Stevens who was\nunknown at the time. The Tremeloes had a huge hit - top five in the UK and top\ntwenty in America. After that, Cat was able to have hits with his own versions of\nhis songs.\n\n\n\n  01. (02:59) - Blessed\n  02. (02:23) - The Right Time\n  03. (01:55) - Good Day Sunshine\n  04.
