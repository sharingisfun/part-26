Thanks to Dr. Jeffrey Thompson, we have a Sonic Labyrinth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ we can Ã¢â‚¬Å“walkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the labyrinth anytime, in our own home. Dr. Thompson meticulously translated this sacred symbol of the Labyrinth through precise mathematical calculations. In doing so, he has rendered the symbol into sound, giving us a very beautiful and very powerful sound recording for meditation and inner change and growth.\n\nNow a person can hear what he/she is seeing or would be seeing when walking the labyrinth, creating a deeply moving and uplifting effect not likely available elsewhere.\n\nHi-Tech Meditation\n\nBrainwave Entrainment uses sound vibrations pulsing at known brainwave speeds, which cause brainwaves to lock onto and follow these sound pulses. This leads to changed states of consciousness for deep stress reduction, relaxation, meditation, etc. Since brainwave patterns are closely associated with specific states of consciousness, brainwave entraining sound pulses can bring the mind into deep states of consciousness very quickly, eliminating years of work and study to achieve.\n\nThe modulated sound pulses, which naturally arise from the interaction of the tones of each concentric ring of the Sonic Labyrinth all vibrating together, also cause this entrainment of consciousness. In this case, the sound frequencies generated by the sound interactions of tones from the Sonic Labyrinth bring the mind into a unique state of consciousness. We may well call this a &quot;Labyrinth Consciousness&quot;. It is the same state of consciousness created by the labyrinth when walked and seen.\n\nHow to Use\n\nThe most powerful use of this program is to listen to it with headphones while walking the same labyrinth pattern, since the sounds are a precise translation of the Labyrinth depicted on the cover of the jewel case insert for this CD. It is very powerful just listening to it with headphones, however. Sitting in a meditation posture is highly recommended.\n\n30 min\n\nreference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\n\nSecure rip and AccurateRip verified.
