Goal was &quot;preview&quot; quality, not the ultimate one - what is self-evident from redicolously small file-size. Trade-offs must be included.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).\nFor example; when I finish encoding, I always check out the file, do short preview, rewinding back and forth. It usualy looks ugly - but - then I move back and sit on the sofa, 6 feet away - and everything looks as it should. Nice and watchable, like on older, analog TV set. Not to force you, but take my advice regarding watching seriously.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fbfb1e631fab8df73c62da402ea86c50bda190a","amp;dn":"Real.Time.With.Bill.Maher.2010.05.21%5Bquark%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fbfb1e631fab8df73c62da402ea86c50bda190a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,191,177,230,49,250,184,223,115,198,45,164,2,234,134,197,11,218,25,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
