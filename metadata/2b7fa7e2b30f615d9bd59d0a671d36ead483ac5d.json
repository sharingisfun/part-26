The series premieres Sunday, March 9 at 10PM ET/PT.\n\nIt takes a special breed to make the desert their home, but these men brave the crippling heat, stealthy predators and volatile weather - in order to live on their own terms. In one of the most hostile environments on Earth, danger is a way of life, but the desert also offers freedom, independence and escape from the work-a-day world.\n\nNO MAN'S LAND follows five hardcore men who live off the land and prove that survival here requires ingenuity, grit and self-reliance.
