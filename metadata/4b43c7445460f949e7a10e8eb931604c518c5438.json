TheyÃƒâ€ ve always had a certain confidence and coolness, and each release shows a new level of maturity and depth. The sextet features two drummers, two guitarists, and a brilliant balance of piano, synths, and acoustic and electric guitars, making the bed upon which singer Stephen Patterson lays his hugely appealing vocals. The slinky, sneaky electro-groove of the album opener, ÃƒÂ´Heavy Metal,ÃƒÂ¶ segues perfectly into &quot;ItÃƒâ€ s Not Me,ÃƒÂ¶ which has the feel of The BeatlesÃƒâ€  Revolver. Next is the grand synth and piano drama of ÃƒÂ´Hold It to the Fire.ÃƒÂ¶ The sleek and sophisticated vibe of ÃƒÂ´Danny Come InsideÃƒÂ¶ and ÃƒÂ´Back for MoreÃƒÂ¶ has a cinematic quality (the Rabbits could perhaps sell shiny black BMWs cruising a cliff-hugging Pacific Coast highway with these tunes). ÃƒÂ´The Day You Won the WarÃƒÂ¶ gives a veiled nod to Prince, with desire-wrapped vocals and whip-cracking rhythms. Anyone willing to trade in obvious hooks for deeper-reaching, multitextured pop with a certain level of braininess will love Milk Famous.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Heavy Metal  (04:28), 10.33 MB\n02.
