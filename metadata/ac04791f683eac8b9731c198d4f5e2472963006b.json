Teenager Michal Sebek (Michael Beran) develops a serious crush on his hip neighbor, Jindriska Kraus (Kristyna Novakova). The problem is that his family is headed by a dull-witted army officer who believes that the latest East German Tupperware will sufficiently shame those American imperialists, while her father is an ardent foe of the Communists saved from prison only because he is a war hero. Much to the parents' dismay, the younger generation couldn't give a fig for politics. Instead, Michal sports a Beatles mop-top and runs a local film group specializing in Hollywood and pre-war French films, while Jindriska starts hanging out with a mysterious hipster.\n\nRip Specs (HD-TV Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Pelisky.1999.720p.HDTV.x264-DON.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 6 447 Kbps\nLength            : 5.22 GiB for 1h 55mn 56s 0ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 000 Kbps\nAspect            : 1224 x 720 (1.700) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : cs\n\nText #0           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167331/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167331/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Czech\nSubtitles: English, Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac04791f683eac8b9731c198d4f5e2472963006b","amp;dn":"Pelisky.1999.720p.HDTV.x264-DON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac04791f683eac8b9731c198d4f5e2472963006b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,4,121,31,104,62,172,139,151,49,193,152,212,245,226,71,41,99,0,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
