When the film was initially released, it caused a huge degree of controversy and thus became one of the most notorious cult films ever made. It made an underground star of the flamboyant female impersonator, Divine. The film also stars David Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce, Mink Stole, Danny Mills, Cookie Mueller, and Edith Massey. Produced on a budget of only $10,000, it was mostly shot on weekends in Phoenix, a suburb of Baltimore, Maryland. After screenings at universities across the U.S. including Harvard College in 1973, the film was picked up by New Line Cinema and became a nationally known film.  The creator, cast, crew and commentators discuss the effect the film has had in world culture.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95b41ae96f349a8e29c61fcc2b337d58080a2b31","amp;dn":"Movies+That+Shook+the+World+-+Pink+Flamingos+%28VHS%29+%28TV%29+%5B2005%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95b41ae96f349a8e29c61fcc2b337d58080a2b31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,180,26,233,111,52,154,142,41,198,31,204,43,51,125,88,8,10,43,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
