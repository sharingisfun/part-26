It is made by snagglepop.com and it is our first release. This is version .01c and it is playable, though incomplete. It is being distributed for feedback. The game is called Poverty. It is an RPG in an 80's style and though the storyline is almost non-existant at this point it deals with modern themes in a fantasy setting.\n\nTo install simply double click the .exe file.
