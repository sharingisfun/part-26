ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now clear that his policies contributed greatly to the transformation of Wall Street from an engine that financed American business to a business-destroying machineÃ¢â‚¬â€and that Greenspan abetted the hollowing out of the U.S. economy by giving Wall Street and Washington everything they could possibly want.\n\nTo take the full measure of GreenspanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s culpability, we need to look beyond the disgraced public persona and see him within the broader sweep of his life and times. In Panderer to Power, author Frederick J. Sheehan delivers the first in-depth, critical biography of the man who, for nearly two decades, served as the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful banker.\n\nBeginning with GreenspanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s formative years as a Depression-era kid from New York City, Sheehan traces his subjectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s progress from his days touring America as a reed man with the Henry Jerome Orchestra in the 1940s through his emergence as one of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first celebrity economists to his ascent through the ranks of power in D.C.\n\nWhat emerges is a searing portrait of a shameless media hound who ferociously promoted his image as a straight-laced numbers cruncher, a Machiavelli whose political skills far surpassed his skills as an economist.\n\nDrawing upon a vast array of original sources, the author leaves little room for doubt: either the Ã¢â‚¬Å“economic genius of our timeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was oblivious to the hazards of his irresponsible policy decisions or he knew full well what he was doing, but chose, as he had throughout his career, to put self-interest above the public good","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b541c7d3e60a50e2443553e53a65e588ac5aecd1","amp;dn":"Sheehan+-+Panderer+to+Power%3B+the+Untold+Story+of+How+Alan+Greens","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b541c7d3e60a50e2443553e53a65e588ac5aecd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,65,199,211,230,10,80,226,68,53,83,229,58,101,229,136,172,90,236,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
