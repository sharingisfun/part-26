This two-part documentary explores the many motivations of the godless and asks: IS ATHEISM THE NEXT GREAT RELIGION?\n\n\n1)  The Congregations \nOur look at the subculture of the godless starts in a group therapy session for people Ã‚â€œrecovering from religionÃ‚â€ where attendees range from those traumatized by their religious upbringing to others who discovered they could no longer believe in a supernatural god. From there, itÃ‚â€™s off to synagogue and church, an openly atheistic church Ã‚â€“ whose congregations donÃ‚â€™t pray to god. Indeed they donÃ‚â€™t recognize Ã‚â€œGod,Ã‚â€ certainly not God as an almighty, supernatural creator of the universe or anything that actually lives. But these congregations do hold services and Sunday schools and even summer camps. What doctrines are they following? Are any relying on big-name new atheists like Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Daniel Dennett as doctrine? And are these faithless indoctrinating their children into Atheism? Find Out.\n\n2)  Spreading the Word \nIn the second part of Godless, we look at the increasing efforts of Ã‚â€œnew atheistsÃ‚â€ and other secularists and non-believers to Ã‚â€œproselytizeÃ‚â€. Featuring more from the new atheists known as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Daniel Dennett) plus grass roots campaigns including everything from comedy acts and de-baptisms to more serious bus campaigns, we ask: are atheists spreading the word or just preaching to the converted? We also hear from atheists who have faced discrimination and even death threats as a consequence of their non-belief, begging the question Ã‚â€“ why do all this for non-belief? Atheists are described as the least trusted group in the US Ã‚â€“ less so than Muslims, despite all their bad press. Is this inevitable or avoidable when you are putting peopleÃ‚â€™s faith on public trial? Viewers will decide that for themselves.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/8122/godlessscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/8122/godlessscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/590/godlessscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/590/godlessscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/650/godlessscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/650/godlessscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/4048/godlessscreen3yz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/4048/godlessscreen3yz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/4563/godlessscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img339.imageshack.us/img339/4563/godlessscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img715.imageshack.us/img715/3521/godlessscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img715.imageshack.us/img715/3521/godlessscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: x264 ,AVC-1\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 192 kbps\nAudio Streams: 2.0\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 45 min\nNumber Of Parts: 2\nPart Size: 900 MB\nRipped by Hukumuzuku\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Brief%20History%20of%20Disbelief&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Brief%20History%20of%20Disbelief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Question%20of%20God&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Question%20of%20God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20God%20who%20Wasnt%20there&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20God%20who%20Wasnt%20there&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHukumuzuku&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AHukumuzuku&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Godless&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Godless&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3abcfb408d1aaa1e32543df20f93f4da775b5dc9","amp;dn":"Godless+2of2+Spreading+The+Word+x264+720p+AC3+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3abcfb408d1aaa1e32543df20f93f4da775b5dc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,188,251,64,141,26,170,30,50,84,61,242,15,147,244,218,119,91,93,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
