That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n=================================\n\n\nNothing to see here.

At least they didn't cost an arm and a leg back then. I am too old to have been into these and my kids didn't happen to be. My boys were Transformers fans.

A little diatribe - In some cases ( I have no idea about this case) the CMX had censored art (must not show nipples, it would corrupt american youth to see a human body - bloody gory deaths, drug use, and worse ok) The scanlations never are the original art naturally, so that's a plus -  but on the other hand the scanlations may have inferior translations. I mean no offense to the translators - these guys put a lot of time and effort into this for free, and big props to them for knowing English and Japanese well enough to do it. Some of the scanlators are 100% bi-lingual and do a superb job.  My niece is half Japanese and 100% bi-lingual and she could do this. She doesn't, but I just thought I'd throws that in there because it's unimportant, but Ican.\n     MegaTokyo c0-4 (Megatokyo.com-cmx substitute\n\n\nI don't know exactly the content of this unscanned comic, but you'll notice the striking similarity to the cover of Metal Hurlant #1, so I'm guessing it's the first few issues of that series, which I have included as a substitute. Metal H. was published in French first, like all Humanoids titles. Some of them are translated to english. Humanoids partnered with DC for a while, then continued to distribute English version in the US on their own. The French original  of this series has a lot more issues. I saw a French issue #179. I don't know how high it goes.\nI have never seen any scanlations of Humanoids titles. Very few European titles are scanlated as opposed to Japanese/Korean/Chinese titles. Manga offers something different and became very popular here, the European titles just aren't different enough to create the demand or just never caught on, or both. Certainly there is no shortage of bi-lingual Europeans, and there are some doing a few other languages. Big cheer for Data9724 and the others involved in that. Their work doesn't come into this series of torrents, but I have it.\n\n     Megalex (Humanoids-unscanned-See Metal Hurlant.jpg\n\nMek 01-03 (Homage(2003)\nMelody p1-p60 (zudacomics-DC Web(2008-2009)\nMemories From Outer Space-Enki Bilal (Humanoids(2005)\n\nMen of Mystery (AC Comics\n     Golden Age Men of Mystery 01-16 (1996-1999)\n     Golden Age Men of Mystery Digest Special 001 123p\n     Men of Mystery Collection 80-xx (2009-20xx)\n     Men of Mystery Spotlight 001 (2001)\n     Men of Mystery v1 17-79(i) (1999-2009)\n\nMen of War 01-26 (1977-1980)\nMenz Insana (Vertigo(1997)\nMerchants of Venus (1986)\nMercy (Vertigo(1993)\n\nAnother Humanoids title not scanned in the DC edition but hopefully this is at least some of the same story material. You  probably don't know the difference so um, yeah it's &quot;exactly the same&quot;, not a page left out, not a panel extra included. If you have the DC edition scan them and prove me wrong or right. You don't even have to edit the scans. Get me the raw files from your scanner software and I can get them to people who would edit them. You could put your name on as credit! And I could tell you how to get into the the places scanners hang out! They won't associate with riff-raff non-scanners like me (and I don't blame them), but I know stuff. I hear things. I lurk outside the door. I bide my time. Someday they'll pay. Oh yesss, they'll pay! I could scan something, but that would be playing their game. I never play other people's games. I only play in my own imaginary world, where everyone loves me.\n\nMetabarons (Humanoids\n     Metabarons 01-17 (Humanoids(2000-2002)\n     Metabarons DC covers\n     Metabarons Universe Guide.pdf\n     The Metabarons 001-The Stonecutters(2000)\n     The Metabarons Book 004 TPB-Aghora &amp; The Last Metabaron ctc (2010)\n\nSee above about Megalex.\nMetal Hurlant v2 01-14 (Humanoids(2002-2004)-subs for megalex\n\nI absolutely LOVED these guys (Metal Men) as a kid in the 60's I haven't got around too reading any of them again though. I'm pretty sure I will never read the post 1974 issues, as comics began to turn in a new direction in the early 1970s. More realistic, &quot;grittier&quot; moving to the &quot;modern AGe&quot; May you find your way as pleasant, but I never wanted that. Give me fantasy and pure escapism  - reality is all around me. I really don't understand people who turn up their noses at escapist stories. I don't care if you like them or not, I don't mean that. To each his own taste, but you don't have to put it down. I'm fine with you liking the modern stuff -  just leave me in the Golden Age where I'm happy. I'm actually afraid to even re-read the 60s stuff as you know, you &quot;can't go home again&quot; I've found a lot of the Batman of that era profoundly disappointing to re-read. I mostly live before about 1962 now but I have been pleased on re-reading  some of the early 60s stuff I read as a kid (e.g. JLA, Hawkman, Atom) so i'll give it a try.\n\nMetal Men\n     Metal Men 040 Original cover art-Mike Sekowsky\n     Metal Men Archives v1 HC-unscanned.jpg\n     Metal Men DCP Archive Edition (2008)\n     Metal Men v1 01-56 (1963-1978)\n     Metal Men v2 01-04 (1993)\n     Metal Men v3 01-08 (2007-2008)\n     Metal Men-DCP Essentials 185p (2007)\n\nMetamorpho Year One 01-06 (2007-2008)\nMetamorpho v1 01-17 (1965-1968)\nMetamorpho v2 01-04 (1993)\nMetropolis Special Crimes Unit 01-04 (1994)\n\nThis is an oddity.

Now many years later, with renewed DC interest in the characters, the story lines were wrapped up at least somewhat as described in &quot;Milestone Forever&quot; below. I haven't read any of these comics but I glanced through the Milestone Forever comics and what I saw corresponded to this info. DC added a typical contrived explanation that explains how these guys moved into the regular DCU. I'm not being critical, what do you want, reality?
