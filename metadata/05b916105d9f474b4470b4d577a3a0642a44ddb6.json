Every morning, Anjelica and her brother visited their father while he took his breakfast in bed. Ã¢â‚¬Å“What news?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ask. Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d seen him the night before,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Anjelica recalls. Ã¢â‚¬Å“There wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t much to report.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ So she became a storyteller.\n\nIn London, where she lives with her mother and brother in the early sixties when her parÃ‚Â­ents separate, Huston encounters the Rolling Stones and Fleetwood Mac. She understudies Marianne Faithfull in Hamlet. Seventeen, striking, precocious, but still young and vulnerable, she is devastated when her mother dies in a car crash.\n\nMonths later she moves to New York, falls in love with the much older, brilliant but disturbed photographer Bob Richardson, and becomes a model. Living in the Chelsea Hotel, working with Richard Avedon and other photographers, she navigates a volatile relationship and the dynamic cultural epicenter of New York in the seventies.\n\nA Story Lately Told ends as Huston launches her Hollywood life. The second part of her storyÃ¢â‚¬â€Watch MeÃ¢â‚¬â€opens in Los Angeles in 1973 and will be published in Fall 2014. Beguiling and beautifully written, HustonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memoir is a treasure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05b916105d9f474b4470b4d577a3a0642a44ddb6","amp;dn":"A+Story+Lately+Told+-+Angelica+Huston","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05b916105d9f474b4470b4d577a3a0642a44ddb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,185,22,16,93,159,71,75,68,112,180,213,119,163,160,100,42,68,221,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
