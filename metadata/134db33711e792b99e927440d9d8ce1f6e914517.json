System  ......: [ ] Macintosh\n   \n   Tower of Guns is a fast paced randomized FPS for the twitch gamer, a short\n   burst &quot;Lunch Break FPS&quot; not unlike Binding of Isaac mixed with Doom 2. If\n   you're gonna win, you're gonna do it within an hour. That's a big if\n   though... it won't be easy. With random enemies, random power ups, random\n   bosses, tons of unlockable items and weapons... and even random-level\n   compositing - You never know what to expect! So grab a rocket-launcher, slap\n   a shotgun-modifier on it, pick up a hundred stackable 'double jumps' (or\n   centuple jumps at that point, I suppose) and get to conquering the Tower of\n   guns!\n  \n   \n   1. UnRAR\n   2. Burn/mount image with your favorite software\n   3. Install game\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:134db33711e792b99e927440d9d8ce1f6e914517","amp;dn":"Tower.Of.Guns-FASiSO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"134db33711e792b99e927440d9d8ce1f6e914517","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,77,179,55,17,231,146,185,158,146,116,64,217,216,206,31,110,145,69,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
