The evidence that many stars are accompanied by planets, the detection of organic material in the circum stellar disks of which planets are created, and claims regarding micro fossils on Martian meteorites have all led to many new empirical searches.\n\n\nAgainst the background of these dramatic new developments in science, SETI critically evaluates claims concerning the status of SETI as a genuine scientific research program and examines the attempts to establish contact with other intelligent life forms in the past thirty years. David Lamb also assess competing theories on the origin of life on Earth, discoveries of ex-solar planets and proposals for space colonies as well as the technical and ethical issues bound up with them. Most importantly, he considers the benefits and drawbacks of communication with new life forms: how we should communicate and whether we should.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c2aeef385dc17bc592863410d5e52c8405858ab","amp;dn":"The+Search+for+Extra+Terrestrial+Intelligence+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c2aeef385dc17bc592863410d5e52c8405858ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,42,238,243,133,220,23,188,89,40,99,65,13,94,82,200,64,88,88,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
