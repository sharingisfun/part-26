The defining feature of Morgellon's Syndrome is the spontaneous exodus of fibers from the epidermis in affected individuals. The vast majority of the medical community believes that persons presenting these symptoms are delusional and are therefore suffering from a mental illness. For the last two years the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States have been investigating persons afflicted with what the CDC term an explained dermopathy and Morgellon's Syndrome for the presence of an infectious aetiology. This book demonstrates evidence of a new microorganism infecting a person complaining of a dermopathy and fibers spontaneously exiting the dermis who was diagnosed with delusional parasitosis. The organism is likely a fungus that lives beneath the epidermis with the ability to infect common fibers including cotton, feathers and hair follicles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa4a920299426672a164f8e41b49131040b0417a","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+Morgellon%5C%27s+Syndrome","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa4a920299426672a164f8e41b49131040b0417a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,74,146,2,153,66,102,114,161,100,248,228,27,73,19,16,64,176,65,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
