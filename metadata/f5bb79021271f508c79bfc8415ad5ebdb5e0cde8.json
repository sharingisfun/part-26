You might get it running on an a system with at least 48MB RAM, but don't expect much (like a GUI). You really need a pentium class computer with at least 128MB RAM. The more RAM the better.\nHow do you install Helix?\n\nIn short you do not install Helix.\n\n1) Burn the cd image (Helix.iso) to a CD.\n2) Make sure that your machine can boot from a CD. (check the BIOS)\n3) Reboot the machine with the CD in the CD-ROM drive.\n4) Use Helix.\n\nIf you want a permanent installation of Helix you have the option of putting it on your harddrive. There is a script that will accomplish that called knx2hd. Keep in mind that this will destroy all existing data on the partition you install it on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5bb79021271f508c79bfc8415ad5ebdb5e0cde8","amp;dn":"Helix+3+-+Computer+Forensic+Live+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5bb79021271f508c79bfc8415ad5ebdb5e0cde8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,187,121,2,18,113,245,8,199,155,252,132,21,173,94,189,181,224,205,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
