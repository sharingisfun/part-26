Praeger, Inc. | 1967 | English | 292 pages | PDF | 31.3 MB\n\n\nThis expert survey provides a complete picture of the remarkable variety and magnificent wealth of the numerous forms of art in Russia. Tamara Talbot Rice, the greatest English authority on Russian art, has set out to cover the entire subject from its beginnings in tenth-century Kiev, the Byzantine-influenced cradle of Russian culture, to the post-revolutionary period and death of the great patron Diaghilev. Mrs Talbot Rice treats sculpture, metalwork, jewelry, ceramics, folk art, and even the lubok (or peasant) woodcut as subjects of an importance equal to that of icons and such buildings as the churches of the Kremlin in Moscow. Particular note must be made of the plates in this book since many of the paintings and objects reproduced come from private collections on the Continent and in the United States and are therefore normally inaccessible","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09565ffa467f3f72e19486ef24db9e4db2e22c63","amp;dn":"A+concise+history+of+Russian+Art+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09565ffa467f3f72e19486ef24db9e4db2e22c63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,86,95,250,70,127,63,114,225,148,134,239,36,219,158,77,178,226,44,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
