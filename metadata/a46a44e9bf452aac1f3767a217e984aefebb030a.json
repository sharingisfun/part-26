This 1968 release finds the ever-evolving drummer in a standard jazz quintet setting.\n\nSongs on Members, DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Git Weary range from the funk grooves of &quot;Abstrutions,&quot; to the gospel-inflected title track, to the modern post-bop feel of &quot;Absolutions.&quot; On the latter, the electric bass colors the song with a decidedly funkier feel. Members  is representative of the emerging late '60s style of jazz that was then developing despite the loss of one of its key innovators, tenor saxophonist John Coltrane. The album hints at changes to come: flux that would cause jazz to collide with rock, R&amp;B, and world music as jazz fusion, or the ultra-intense experimentalism that would finally reach its height in the '70s avant-garde of the Art Ensemble of Chicago. This is an album that adds to jazz's great conversation, and for this reason alone, it's worth investigating.\n\n[color=lime][b]Tracklist:[/b]\n01.Abstrutions (3:40)\n02.Libra (4:57)\n03.Effi (6:15)\n04.Equipoise (6:22)\n05.Members, DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Git Weary (5:31)\n06.Absolutions (4:41)\n\nRecorded at RCA Studio B, New York, New York in June 1968.
