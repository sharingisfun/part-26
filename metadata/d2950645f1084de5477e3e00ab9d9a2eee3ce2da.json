The Scarlet Letter is a faithful adaptation of the classic American novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne:\n\nAdulteress Hester Prynne must wear a scarlet A to mark her shame. Her lover, Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale, remains unidentified and is wracked with guilt, while her husband, Roger Chillingworth, seeks revenge. The Scarlet Letter's symbolism helps create a powerful drama in Puritan Boston: a kiss, evil, sin, nature, the scarlet letter, and the punishing scaffold. Nathaniel Hawthorne's masterpiece is a classic example of the human conflict between emotion and intellect.\n\n\n\n\n*ABOUT THIS NEW SOUNDTRACK:\nFrench baroque music is alternated with Poulenc's Concert ChampÃƒÂªtre for harpsichord and orchestra and his Concerto in G minor for organ, timpani and strings.\n\nRead more here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/jolonquessoundtracks/the-scarlet-letter-1926&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/jolonquessoundtracks/the-scarlet-letter-1926&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2950645f1084de5477e3e00ab9d9a2eee3ce2da","amp;dn":"The.Scarlet.Letter.1926.new.soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2950645f1084de5477e3e00ab9d9a2eee3ce2da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,149,6,69,241,8,77,229,71,126,62,0,171,157,154,46,238,60,226,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
