They&amp;#039;re very good at seeking out and doing what they enjoy. Problem is, the current culture tends to view slackers as do-nothing layabouts. In truth, when you let a slacker do something they enjoy--and pay them for it--you&amp;#039;ve got the worlds best employee on your hands. This manifesto is for the slackers who work for a living.\n\nIncluding: Knowing that you&amp;#039;re a slacker and coming to grips with it; understanding the difference between being an effective slacker @ work, and being lazy; understanding why you work; the Four Hour Rule and other tricks of the trade; locating influential champions who will spread the good news about you within the workplace...and more!\n\nAbout the author:\nBrendon Connelly is a highly effective slacker. Previously an Organizational Development Manager for a Fortune 500 subsidiary, he&amp;#039;s now a university administrator and co-founder of FinAidPro.com (http://finaidpro.com/). Brendon still prefers surfing, skateboarding, or hanging out with his family to working. And thus, this manifesto.\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____| ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3de3fcf66cced3355a52cd25d3ae9249b497b15a","amp;dn":"%28PDF%29Manifesto.Slacker.%40.Work-LegalTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3de3fcf66cced3355a52cd25d3ae9249b497b15a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,227,252,246,108,206,211,53,90,82,205,37,211,174,146,73,180,151,177,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
