In fact, the only other performer featured on this set is Peterson&amp;#039;s longtime bassist Ray Brown, whose contributions are minimal. These songs, from the mellifluous &quot;Mean to Me&quot; to a languid &quot;April in Paris,&quot; are simple and beautiful.\n\nPersonnel:\nElla Fitzgerald - Vocals\nOscar Peterson - Piano\nRay Brown - Double Bass\n\nTrack listing:\n   1.
