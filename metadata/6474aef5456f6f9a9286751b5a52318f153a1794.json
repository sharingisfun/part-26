However, six manage to escape to the official \nresidence of the Canadian Ambassador and the CIA is eventually ordered to get \nthem out of the country. With few options, exfiltration expert Tony Mendez devises \na daring plan: to create a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran \nand smuggle the Americans out as its production crew. With the help of some \ntrusted Hollywood contacts, Mendez creates the ruse and proceeds to Iran as its \nassociate producer. However, time is running out with the Iranian security forces \nclosing in on the truth while both his charges and the White House have grave \ndoubts about the operation themselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6474aef5456f6f9a9286751b5a52318f153a1794","amp;dn":"Argo.2012.720p.BluRay.x264.YIFY.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6474aef5456f6f9a9286751b5a52318f153a1794","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,116,174,245,69,111,111,154,146,134,117,27,90,82,49,143,21,58,23,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
