Credit CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tu for an open ear for whatever works, which is precisely why &quot;Sadeness,&quot;\nthe first part of a longer track called &quot;Principles of Lust,&quot; turned into a fluke worldwide hit. Snippets of monks\ninvoking the Almighty effortlessly glide in and out of a polite but still strong breakbeat, shimmering, atmospheric\nsynth and flute lines and a Frenchwoman whispering in a way that sounds distinctly more carnal than spiritual\n(as her gasps for breath elsewhere make clear).\n\nGuitar and male vocals add to the album version's try-anything-that-works approach, as do attempts at shuffling\njazz beats and horns. If nothing quite equals that prime moment elsewhere on the album, MCMXC A.D. still trips\nout on the possibilities as it can, right from the opening &quot;Voice of Enigma,&quot; inviting all listeners to sit back, relax,\nand take a gentle trip. CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tu certainly isn't trying to hide anything -- &quot;Callas Went Away&quot; goes right ahead and adds\na sample of Maria Callas herself to the chirping birds and soft beats, while elsewhere the flutes, beats, monks, and\nFrench voices merrily go about their glossy business. About the only thing missing is the kitchen sink, making the\nentire album the &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; of its day.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nEnigma - MCMXC a.D.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nArtist....................................: Enigma\nAlbum.................................: MCMXC a.D.\nGenre..................,.................: New Age\nSource........................................: CD\nYear........................................: 1990\n\nRipper: Exact Audio Copy V1.0 b1 &amp; HP DVD RW AD-7701H\n\nCodec...........: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion.........: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality.......: Lossless, (avg. compression: 53 %)\nChannels..............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags...............................: VorbisComment\n\nInformation..: Original 1990 German Pressing\n\nRipped by..............: BSW on 7/9/2011\nPosted by..............: BSW on 7/9/2011\nNews Server..........: news.astraweb.com\n\nNews Group(s).: alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.metal.full.albums\n\nIncluded....: NFO, SFV, M3U, LOG, CUE\nCovers................: Front Back CD\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n1.
