The addition of DioÃƒÂ¢??s fantasy and medieval lyrics to BlackmoreÃƒÂ¢??s intricate \nand quite dazzling riff and solo play was instrumental in laying down the grass roots of the Melodic Power Metal movement of today. Of \ncourse there are no crashing riffs and thundering drums to be found here nah RAINBOW consisted of two master craftsmen who \nweaved dazzling patterns of ingenious light and dark into hard edge music that has lasted exceptionally well after all these years.\nKicking of with the classic ÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢??Man On The Silver MountainÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢?? (a song that has endured well into its fourth decade and still a part of DIOÃƒÂ¢??s \nlive set) and leading onto ÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢??Self PortraitÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢?? a quirky but hugely catchy song with Ronnie JamesÃƒÂ¢?? fine voice. ÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢??Black Sheep Of The FamilyÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢?? is \na dip in form and harks back to Ronnie JamesÃƒÂ¢??s days in ELF which starts well but soon descends into a bad idea. However ÃƒÂ¢??Catch The \nRainbowÃƒÂ¢?? a six minute ballad that has Ronnie James, once again, grabbing all the lime light (a precedent that was to ultimately split the \nband) His voice is serene and compassionate yet very powerful showing his versatility on softer songs but not forgetting his dynamics \non harder cuts like ÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢??Snake CharmerÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢?? and ÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢??Sixteenth Century GreensleevesÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢??. The albumÃƒÂ¢??s outstanding track must be ÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢??Temple Of The \nKingÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢?? that is a pre-cursor to BlackmoreÃƒÂ¢??s future dabbling in Renaissance music some twenty-five years later but the song is an absolute \ngem and a long forgotten masterpiece.\nWhat makes this debut album so strong and therefore so memorable is the writing partnership between Dio and Blackmore. At long \nlast Blackmore had found a vocalist that could match his vision of technical yet melodically inspired music and Dio could belt it out with \nthe best but at the same time reduce his voice to emotive passages that gave Blackmore much scope to develop the unique RAINBOW \nsound. Last but not least the guitar playing by Blackmore has rarely been equalled. It is imaginative, technically demanding and the \nwork of a genius.\nGreat minds think alike and on ÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢??RainbowÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢?? both Blackmore and Dio had left a lasting impression that is still felt today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:108cbc5c8de571fb9400af1e29779dae26ed7909","amp;dn":"Ritchie+Blackmore%5C%27s+Rainbow+%281975%29+%281999+Rem.%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"108cbc5c8de571fb9400af1e29779dae26ed7909","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,140,188,92,141,229,113,251,148,0,175,30,41,119,157,174,38,237,121,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
