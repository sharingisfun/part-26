Washington DC 20009\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nProject Welcome Home Troops provides training in unique trauma relief practices to veterans and their families. While focused on veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, veterans from all eras will be trained. Training begins with a 16 hour workshop taught over 5-6 days. After the workshop, continuous follow-up support will be provided through weekly group sessions, private consultations and periodic residential weekend retreats.\n\nThe projectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trauma relief practices have been used successfully for 26 years. Initially taught as a stress-reduction program, the practices were adopted for trauma relief by the International Association for Human Values (IAHV). IAHV is a nonprofit United Nations chartered NGO and humanitarian organization that organizes volunteers for charitable work that often includes teaching trauma relief practices at disaster sites and in war zones. IAHV is the sponsor of Project\nWelcome Home Troops.\n\nMany applications of this training have demonstrated the effectiveness of the practices including:\n\npolice departments, United Nations forces, active-duty soldiers, prisoners and corrections officers, depression sufferers in Baghdad and New York after 9/11, and with disaster survivors.\n\nVideos and personal accounts from participants can be seen on the website, www.pwht.org.\n\nThe most extensive use of this program for war-related trauma occurred in Kosovo where a large percentage of the population suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Thousands of traumatized military veterans and civilians in Kosovo have taken this program. Participants\nreport extraordinary relief from stress, trauma and PTSD.\nAn Urgent Need for Early Treatment\nThe longer treatment for PTSD is delayed, the worse the symptoms can become. Hundreds of\nthousands of new veterans will develop PTSD, a debilitating condition that, if left untreated, can\nlead to substance abuse, homelessness, severe depression/anxiety, and suicide. Unfortunately, the\ninitial response of returning OIF/OEF veterans is to not seek treatment. The most severe\nsymptoms may not show-up for 1 to 3 years after retuning home. Veteran aid organizations\nare not seeing many new veterans until the severity of their problems becomes a crisis.\nAn Effective Program Available Now\nInstructors from the International Association for Human Values, veterans, and psychiatrists and\npsychologists skilled in the treatment of PTSD, have designed the Warrior Breath Workshop.\nIAHV trauma-workshop leaders have been trained in combat PTSD and are volunteering to lead\nworkshops now. The effectiveness of any PTSD treatment program can be greatly enhanced by\nincluding the Warrior Breath Workshop training.\nThe men and women who served in our military deserve our help. Multiple deployments and the\ncharacter of the war have left emotional scars that require multiple treatments to heal. The sooner\ntreatment can begin, the sooner veterans and their families can move past the negative effects of\nPTSD. We must not allow this generationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s veterans to add to the large number of veterans who\nalready make up half the homeless in this country. The Warrior Breath WorkshopÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s proven\ntechnology will make a significant difference toward achieving that goal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b783030a368edd43ecb0ce84c7644df21f057da6","amp;dn":"Sudarshan+Kriya+-+Sri+Sri+Ravi+Shankar+-Providing+Essential+Stre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b783030a368edd43ecb0ce84c7644df21f057da6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,131,3,10,54,142,221,67,236,176,206,132,199,100,77,242,31,5,125,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
