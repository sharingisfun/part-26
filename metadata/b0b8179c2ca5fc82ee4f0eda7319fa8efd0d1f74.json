Though we witnessed or experienced treachery and tragedy, we did not allow that darkness to overshadow the light. We learned to listen to the voices of illumination; more than listen, we learned to hear and to respond. And now we turn to Coming Home. Now we turn to seeking God/Goddess/All That Is with greater resolve and greater light. And what do we find? We can discover the splendor; we can discover the splendor of ourselves.\n\n\nAs the remaining days of this amazing weekend unfolded, Lazaris guided us with a bit of magic and a lot of love as we experienced the search and as we found our splendor. This evening is not the whole of the weekend, but it offers us the map and the gems of this culminating weekend so that we can remember and reunite . . . so that we can again be touched by our own splendor. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://shop.lazaris.com/Coming_Home_Seeking_God_Godde_P569C49.cfm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://shop.lazaris.com/Coming_Home_Seeking_God_Godde_P569C49.cfm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0b8179c2ca5fc82ee4f0eda7319fa8efd0d1f74","amp;dn":"Lazaris+-+Finding+the+Splendor+of+Yourself","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0b8179c2ca5fc82ee4f0eda7319fa8efd0d1f74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,184,23,156,44,165,252,130,238,79,14,218,115,25,250,142,253,13,31,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
