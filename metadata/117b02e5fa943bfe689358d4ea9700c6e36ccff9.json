One is a history of God preserving His words through His people. The other is of the devil using the Roman Catholic 'church' to pervert God's words through her &quot;scholars.&quot;\n\nWritten in a down-to-earth style, and packed with cartoon illustrations by Jack Chick, Daniels shows that the Bibles Rome gave us are really clever counterfeits, designed to eliminate God's preserved words in English, the KJV. You will see why the KJV is the only Bible you can trust.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDavid Daniels, B.A., M.Div., is trained in Bible, theology and linguistics. After twenty years of searching the Hebrew and Greek scriptures and studying the history of the Bible, he concluded that the King James Bible is God's preserved words in English. He is currently Research Consultant for Chick Publications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:117b02e5fa943bfe689358d4ea9700c6e36ccff9","amp;dn":"Did+The+Catholic+Church+Give+Us+The+Bible%3F+-+David+W.+Daniel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"117b02e5fa943bfe689358d4ea9700c6e36ccff9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,123,2,229,250,148,59,254,104,147,88,212,234,151,0,198,227,108,207,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
