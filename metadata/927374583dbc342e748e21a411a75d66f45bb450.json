The state of Amn is under \r\nsiege to the south, the High Moor is being overrun in the north and the \r\nregion around Baldur's Gate is in turmoil. In an area known for its ample \r\nresources, a crippling shortage is slowly developing for the metal that \r\nis used throughout the Realms for everything from swords to forks - iron.\r\n\r\nWhat's worse, trading caravans coming from all directions into Baldur's \r\nGate are under constant attack from bandits and cutthroats who loot not \r\nfor gold and gems but for iron. The armed factions in Baldur's Gate can \r\nscarcely keep themselves armed and the commoners are suffering all the \r\nmore. Without iron they cannot mend their tools or purchase plows - and \r\neveryone knows that if they cannot farm or craft, they will starve come \r\nwinter... Enthralling story, vast and rich open world, and classic \r\nDungeons and Dragons rules and Forgotten Realms setting make this title \r\na must-have in every self-respecting cRPG fan collection!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:927374583dbc342e748e21a411a75d66f45bb450","amp;dn":"Baldur%27s+Gate+The+Original+Saga+-+LINUX+-+GOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"927374583dbc342e748e21a411a75d66f45bb450","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,115,116,88,61,188,52,46,116,142,33,164,17,167,93,102,244,91,180,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
