Through unseen home movies, the film reveals how Otis's 1967 tour of Britain dramatically changed his life and music. After bringing soul to Europe he returned to conquer America, first with the 'love-crowd' at the Monterey Festival and then with Dock of the Bay, which topped the charts only after his death at just 26. Includes rare and unseen performances, intimate interviews with Otis's wife and daughter, and with original band members Steve Cropper and Booker T Jones. Also featured are British fans whose lives were changed by seeing him, among them Rod Stewart, Tom Jones and Bryan Ferry.\n\n\nVideo Codec....: H.264\nFrame.Rate.....: 25 FPS\nResolution.......: 832 x 468\nAspect.Ratio....: 16.9\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d8a0b8a2c831b111bce774b9f4c9f48bc7c3f24","amp;dn":"Otis+Redding+-+Soul+Ambassador","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d8a0b8a2c831b111bce774b9f4c9f48bc7c3f24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,138,11,138,44,131,27,17,27,206,119,75,159,76,159,72,188,124,63,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
