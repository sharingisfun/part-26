But the project to erect immunological shields against deadly pathogens is far from complete Ã¢â‚¬â€ some of the most lethal diseases still lack effective vaccines. Moreover, major inequities exist in the global distribution of vaccines. Despite substantial advances in vaccine production and development, global efforts to eradicate disease through inoculation still face scientific, technological and economic hurdles.\n\n======================================================\n\nSeek And Destroy - March 6, 2014\n\n122 Pages | True PDF | English | 36 MB\n\nCRISPR/Cas9-based DNA targeting has quickly become a leading tool in the fields of synthetic biology and genome engineering. It exploits the ability of a bacterial endonuclease, Cas9, guided by an RNA molecule, to target virtually any matching DNA sequence of interest for binding and/or cleavage.\n\n======================================================\n\nPractical Microfluidics - March 13, 2014\n\n137 Pages | True PDF | English | 24 MB\n\nMicrofluidics exploits the properties of fluids trapped in submillimetre-scale spaces Ã¢â‚¬â€ the physics behind inkjet printing, DNA microarrays, lab-on-a-chip chemistry and much else Ã¢â‚¬â€ to useful practical effect. In the past decade microfluidic devices have shown considerable promise in diagnostics and primary research in the biological sciences.\n\n======================================================\n\nA Sense of Direction - March 20, 2014\n\n252 Pages | True PDF | English | 24 MB\n\nThe motion-detecting cells of the retina, called direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), have been known about and studied for more than half a century but their precise role in visual processing has remained unclear. Using a combination of genetic, anatomical and imaging techniques, Andrew Huberman and colleagues investigate the connections made by DSGCs in the mouse brain and find that they link specifically to neurons in the superficial layers of primary visual cortex. \n\n======================================================\n\nHow To Keep A Secret - March 27, 2014\n\n128 Pages | True PDF | English | 27 MB\n\nCan you keep secrets safe from eavesdroppers? Yes you can, say Artur Ekert and Renato Renner. They argue that recent developments in quantum cryptography, coupled with the fact that we still possess free will, suggest that truly private communication will always be possible, even in a world with access to as yet undiscovered code-breaking technologies. The answer lies in new insights into the nature of randomness and non-local correlations.\n\n======================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc1b7ca1d09d118f30a05dd8b2f15d5c5d01c751","amp;dn":"N%D0%B0tur%D0%B5+M%D0%B0g%D0%B0zin%D0%B5+-+March+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc1b7ca1d09d118f30a05dd8b2f15d5c5d01c751","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,27,124,161,208,157,17,143,48,160,93,216,178,241,93,92,93,1,199,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
