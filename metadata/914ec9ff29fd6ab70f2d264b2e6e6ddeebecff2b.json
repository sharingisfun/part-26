Poor Bob\\'s Blues collects recordings Williams did for Harry Oster\\'s Folk-Lyric label between 1959 (when Oster discovered him at Angola Prison in Louisiana) and Williams\\' death in 1980, and it forms a wonderful introduction to this unique bluesman. The opening track on disc one, a slow, unaccompanied moan called \\&quot;My Mind Wandering Around,\\&quot; sets the tone here, as Williams\\' improvised lyrics and spoken explanatory asides build into a remarkably personal meditation that is really unlike anything else in country blues. Even when Williams borrows from the kit bag of floating blues clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s, he couples them with his own improvised perspective, recycling them in the truest sense, as he does here with the ancient \\&quot;Poor Boy, Long Way from Home,\\&quot; which emerges as a personal statement rather than a tired recasting of one of the most versioned songs in the blues canon. Other highlights include the powerful \\&quot;Cane Cut Man,\\&quot; \\&quot;Things All Wrong With Me,\\&quot; which features some nice jackknife slide, and \\&quot;What a Shape I\\'m In.\\&quot; With excellent liner notes and track-by-track annotation, Poor Bob\\'s Blues makes a perfect introduction to this truly one-of-a-kind bluesman.\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1\n\n1.
