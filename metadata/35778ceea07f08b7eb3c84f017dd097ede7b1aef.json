Of course, what you learn here will be enough to get you started on creating your own custom command prompt, as well!\n\nBefore we get started, I want to make something extremely clear. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m certainly a command line enthusiast, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not at all a command line pro. I feel at home in a terminal, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a far cry from knowing everything. So hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the deal: IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to show you how IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve set up my terminal, but that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to explain every single line of code weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll look at. There are some things here that are the way they are just because thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what works Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always 100% know why.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35778ceea07f08b7eb3c84f017dd097ede7b1aef","amp;dn":"TutsPlus+-+How+To+Customize+Your+Terminal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35778ceea07f08b7eb3c84f017dd097ede7b1aef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,119,140,238,160,127,8,183,235,60,132,240,23,221,9,126,222,123,26,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
