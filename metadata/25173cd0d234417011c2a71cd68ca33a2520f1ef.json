The Evinrude was the same with a different colour paint job.  I included some of the other information that came with the manual as well.\n\nPlease take the time to scan and share manuals you may have.  I personally have a large collection of old outboards, and would appreciate any information I could get for them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25173cd0d234417011c2a71cd68ca33a2520f1ef","amp;dn":"1968+Johnson+9.5+Owners+manual+Winman99.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25173cd0d234417011c2a71cd68ca33a2520f1ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,23,60,208,210,52,65,112,17,194,167,28,214,140,163,58,37,32,241,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
