Unfortunately for them various other factions are closing in, hellbent on gaining the mythical power of the artifact for themselves.\n\nA hugely offensive exercise in excess, Fantacide Recently appeared at number eight in the hundred goriest movies ever made, and is without doubt the bloodiest film to ever come out of the UK, bar none. This is the full uncut version, which is hilarious and twisted in about equal measure. If you like off the wall humour coupled with outlandish gore you'll love this!\n\nThough low-budget, it packs a hell of a wallop.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:565acbebd81be560e15c48af343a724b04dd49d2","amp;dn":"Fantacide.%282007%29.Uncut.Version.DvdRip.By.Arris.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"565acbebd81be560e15c48af343a724b04dd49d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,90,203,235,216,27,229,96,225,92,72,175,52,58,114,75,4,221,73,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
