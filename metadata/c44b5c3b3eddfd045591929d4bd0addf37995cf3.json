Written for the Senior Design Course, and also suitable for introduction to chemical engineering courses, it covers the basics of unit operations and the latest aspects of process design, equipment selection, plant and operating economics, safety and loss prevention. It is a textbook that students will want to keep through their undergraduate education and on into their professional lives.\n-New to this edition:\n\nRevised organization into Part I: Process Design, and Part II: Plant Design. The broad themes of Part I are flowsheet development, economic analysis, safety and environmental impact and optimization. Part II contains chapters on equipment design and selection that can be used as supplements to a lecture course or as essential references for students or practicing engineers working on design projects.\nNew discussion of conceptual plant design, flowsheet development and revamp design\nSignificantly increased coverage of capital cost estimation, process costing and economics\nNew chapters on equipment selection, reactor design and solids handling processes\nNew sections on fermentation, adsorption, membrane separations, ion exchange and chromatography\nIncreased coverage of batch processing, food, pharmaceutical and biological processes\nAll equipment chapters in Part II revised and updated with current information\nUpdated throughout for latest US codes and standards, including API, ASME and ISA design codes and ANSI standards\nAdditional worked examples and homework problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c44b5c3b3eddfd045591929d4bd0addf37995cf3","amp;dn":"Chemical+Engineering+Design+Second+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c44b5c3b3eddfd045591929d4bd0addf37995cf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,75,92,59,62,221,253,4,85,145,146,157,75,208,173,223,55,153,92,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
