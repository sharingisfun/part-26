As with Arctic Monkeys on Suck It And\nSee, Money And Celebrity finds the band melding elements from their\nprevious efforts to come up with a sound that is quintessentially their\nown, providing a high octane, tight blast of indie pop/rock along the\nway.\n\nOpening with the frenetic ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦ItÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s A PartyÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â , the album barely pauses for\nbreath with a succession of tracks clocking in around the three minute\nmark - and itÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s to the bandÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s credit that they never blend into one\nanother, partly due to clever track listing. The jaunty ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦Down Our\nStreetÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  is deftly followed by the dirty bass-heavy opening of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦RumourÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ,\nfor example, but the tracks all share something in common: the innate\nability to latch into your memory. The immediacy of the entire album is\nreally quite incredible, especially in the case of the aforementioned\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦Down Our StreetÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  which might not be BillyÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s strongest songwriting\nmoment (ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Every door has something more to talk about / Every problem\nfinds a way to get aroundÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶) and yet, we'll bet our house youÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â re still\nsinging the chorus days later.\n\nLead single ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦We DonÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t Need Money To Have A Good TimeÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  is an absolute\nblast, a rollicking beast of a track with a naysayers be damned\nattitude ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´We got no education but we find a way / Not gonna be the\nones to walk awayÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶. You get the feeling that itÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s going to be a\nfoundation shaker live and, if anything, the same could be said of the\nmajority of Money And Celebrity. ItÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s as though it was written with the\nlive arena firmly in mind with the likes of soft acoustic sections\nleading to big endings (ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦RumourÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ), clapping refrains (ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦I Wanna Dance\nWith YouÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ) and, for most of the tracks, effectively simplistic\nsingalong choruses. It doesnÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t diminish the listen on CD but thereÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s no\ndoubt tracks will be elevated by being played in front of a receptive\ncrowd.\n\nIt's generally strong lyrically as well, mainly casting a window on\ntodayÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s society focussing on the titular topics. The protagonist of\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦CelebrityÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  is not too dissimilar from a reality TV star, essentially\nsomeone who wants to be famous without doing anything: ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´She wants to\nride in a chauffeured car / Her photograph in the morning papers / Cos\nin this world itÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s who you are / And all she knows is she wants to be\nfamousÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶. While ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦PopdeathÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  is horribly relevant given recent events ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â»\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´And you can care if you really want / Sing their songs when theyÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â re\ndead and gone / You can bleed for the tortured souls / Too much sex and\nrockÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â rollÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶. It might not be the subtlest but gives the album an\nobvious spine that lends it a cohesion.\n\nIt lacks the variation that All Or Nothing provided but when not one\nfiller is delivered along the way, it seems churlish to complain -\nespecially when the outstanding ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦Leave My SideÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â  ends proceedings. One\nof the best things The Subways have ever done, itÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s a heartfelt,\npowerful track that encompasses everything about the band: catchy\nchorus, deft male/female vocal harmonies and a big riff to hold it all\ntogether. Money And Celebrity confirms them as one of the most exciting\nBritish bands around and we can only hope it brings them the commercial\nsuccess they thoroughly deserve. Treasure it, itÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s might be all we have\nfor another three years.\n\nDeluxe edition which comes with a bonus CD called &quot;Billy's Demo\nRecordings&quot;.
