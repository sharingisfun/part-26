Over the next 100 years, although still relatively few in number, they were frequently dispatched overseas in a key role when U.S. interests were threatened. The Marines saw action in many places. Using some remarkable archive footage, this program develops the valiant story of the story of the U.S. Marines through World War 2 to Korea and Vietnam.\n\nAs old as the nation itself, the United States Marine Corps was created in 1775 as a form of naval security for American military forces during the Revolutionary War. Since then, the Marines have evolved into the nation's foremost combat unit with a well-earned reputation as &quot;the first to fight,&quot; serving as the main force in the Pacific theater of World War II, the first line of offense in the Korean War, and the first and last branch of the U.S. military to leave Vietnam. Part of THE WAR ZONE series, this documentary recounts the storied history of the legendary U.S. Marine Corps through interviews, voiceover narration, and archival footage.\n\nIf you need a seed, PM me here: http://suprbay.org/member.php?u=74576","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf9fca84280489b629f03e48ab9c91c79e12255b","amp;dn":"U.S.+Marine+Corps+%28Documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf9fca84280489b629f03e48ab9c91c79e12255b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,159,202,132,40,4,137,182,41,240,62,72,171,156,145,199,158,18,37,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
