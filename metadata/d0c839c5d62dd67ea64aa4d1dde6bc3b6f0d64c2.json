More than telling a story, I felt like the film painted a picture of confusion in the mind of an unstable youth stuck in an environment alternately hostile and sometimes seeming downright benevolent (or was that only in his mind?). Hardly a typical behind bars film, it breaks some barriers in story telling, and throws some imagery your way that may be indelible.\n\nNo extras whatsoever.\n\nUncompressed PAL DVD5 VIDEO_TS files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0c839c5d62dd67ea64aa4d1dde6bc3b6f0d64c2","amp;dn":"David+Hayman+-+Iain+Glen+-+Silent+Scream+%281990%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0c839c5d62dd67ea64aa4d1dde6bc3b6f0d64c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,200,57,197,214,45,214,126,166,74,164,209,221,230,188,59,111,13,100,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
