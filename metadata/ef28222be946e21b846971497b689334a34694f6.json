This album, Stevens second during 1970, includes many of Stevens most well-known songs including *Where Do the Children Play?,* *Hard Headed Woman,* *Wild World,* *Sad Lisa,* *Into White* and *Father and Son.* Four of the tracks (*Where Do the Children Play?*, *On the Road to Find Out*, *Tea for the Tillerman* and *Miles from Nowhere*) were featured in the Hal Ashby and Colin Higgins black comedy film entitled Harold and Maude, in 1971. The track *But I Might Die Tonight* was featured on another 1971 film: Deep End by Jerzy Skolimowski. Stevens, a former art student, created the artwork featured on the records cover. With *Wild World* as an advance single, this was the album that brought Stevens world-wide fame. The album itself charted into the top 10 in the United States, where he had previously had few listeners.\n\nOn 18 November, 2003, Rolling Stone Magazine included this album in its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list at number 206. In 2006, the album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.
