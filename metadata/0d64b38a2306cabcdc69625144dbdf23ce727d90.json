Yet his turn as a slick, upscale mainstay of adult contemporary radio was simply the latest phase of a long and varied career, one that's seen the former teenage R&amp;B shouter move through jazz, psychedelia, blues-rock, and progressive rock. Possessed of a powerful, utterly distinctive voice, Winwood was also an excellent keyboardist who remained an in-demand session musician for most of his career, even while busy with high-profile projects. That background wasn't necessarily apparent on his solo records, which established a viable commercial formula that was tremendously effective as long as it was executed with commitment.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Gimme Some Lovin'\n02.I'm A Man\n03.Paper Sun\n04.Dear Mr. Fantasy\n05.Pearly Queen\n06.Forty Thousand Headmen\n07.Had To Cry Today\n08.Can't Find My Way Home\n09.John Barleycorn (Must Die)\n10.Empty Pages\n11.The Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d64b38a2306cabcdc69625144dbdf23ce727d90","amp;dn":"Steve+Winwood+-+20th+Century+Masters+Best+Of+%281999%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d64b38a2306cabcdc69625144dbdf23ce727d90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,100,179,138,35,6,202,188,220,105,98,81,68,219,223,35,206,114,125,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
