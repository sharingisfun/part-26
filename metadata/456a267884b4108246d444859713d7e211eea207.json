Ray Canterbery, &quot;A brief history of economics: Artful approaches to the dismal science&quot;\nEnglish | ISBN: 9810238487 | 2001 | PDF | 481 pages | 25,58 mb\n\n&quot;A Brief History of Economics&quot; illustrates how the ideas of the great economists not only influenced societies but were themselves shaped by their cultural milieu. Understanding the economists' visions - lucidly and vividly unveiled by Canterbery -allows readers to place economics within a broader community of ideas. Magically, the author links Adam Smith to Isaac Newton's idea of an orderly universe, F. Scott Fitzgerald's &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; to Thornstein Veblen, John Steinbeck's &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; to the Great Depression, and Tom Wolfe's &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; to Reaganomics. Often humorous, Canterbery's easy style should make the student's first foray into economics lively and relevant. Readers will no longer dare call it the &quot;dismal science&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:456a267884b4108246d444859713d7e211eea207","amp;dn":"A+brief+history+of+economics%3A+Artful+approaches+to+the+dismal+sc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"456a267884b4108246d444859713d7e211eea207","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,106,38,120,132,180,16,130,70,212,68,133,151,19,215,226,17,238,162,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
