The book starts with an introduction to fly-tying basics, material, equipment and techniques. The flies themselves are divided into five categories, Dry Flies, Nymphs and Bugs, Wet Flies, Streamers and Hairwings and covers patterns that have a proven record of success in catching rainbow and brown trout, sea trout, salmon and grayling in rivers and lakes throughout the world. On each spread there is a key indicating which species the fly is designed to attract, a brief description of when and how it should be used, a full-colour photograph of the finished fly indicating the materials used for body, rib, hackle, and so on, the range of hook sizes for which the pattern is suitable and, on the facing page, step-by-step instructions for tying.\n\nTitle: Fly-Tying Bible\nPublisher: Aurum Press Ltd\nAuthor: Peter Gathercole\nYear: 2006\nFormat: PDF\n\n\n=================================================================\n\n\n-nelly- home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/-nelly-/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/-nelly-/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!\n\n           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor re-seed requests, help, support or anything else relating to The Pirate Bay.
