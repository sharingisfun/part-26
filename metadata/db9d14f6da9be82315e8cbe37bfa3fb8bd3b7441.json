And energy is what its citizens have, whether for skiing, work, or construction. It is a city that leaps ahead eagerly to new futures and rarely looks back., but Calgary can also be an unsentimental city, discarding its ideas, plans, and buildings with ease.\n\nUnbuilt Calgary is a survey of 30 projects that were proposed but not realized, schemes that were situated at critical times in Calgary's development, and proposals that indicated the city's ambitions through its first 100 years. Unbuilt Calgary looks back to ideas and notions that might have been, and building endeavours that would have changed the shape of the city for better or worse. The 30 critical projects are accompanied by drawings and models to illustrate something of Calgary's irrepressible exuberance.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db9d14f6da9be82315e8cbe37bfa3fb8bd3b7441","amp;dn":"Unbuilt+Calgary+by+Stephanie+White","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db9d14f6da9be82315e8cbe37bfa3fb8bd3b7441","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,157,20,246,218,155,232,35,21,232,203,227,123,250,63,184,189,59,116,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
