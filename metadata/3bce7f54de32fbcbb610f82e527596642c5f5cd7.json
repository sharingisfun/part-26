SMAC changes the &quot;software based&quot; MAC addresses, and the new MAC addresses you change will sustain from reboots.\n\nSMAC helps people to protect their privacy by hiding their real MAC Addresses in the widely available wifi Wireless Network.  SMAC also helps Network and IT Security professionals to troubleshoot network problems, test Intrusion Detection / Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS,) test Incident Response plans, build high-availability solutions, recover (MAC Address based) software licenses, and etc... \n\nSMAC is the first Windows MAC Address Modifying Utility (since 2002), and it is developed base on the extensive research of KLC Consulting, Inc.  SMAC is continuous updated with the latest trend in the networking and security, as well as valuable customers&amp;#039; wishes and feedbacks.\n\n\n\n\n*************************************************************************** \n***************************************************************************\n***************************************************************************\n***************************************************************************\n\n\nMade by:\n\n***************\n****PLANNED****\n***************\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bce7f54de32fbcbb610f82e527596642c5f5cd7","amp;dn":"Smac+2.0-+%23Planned%23","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bce7f54de32fbcbb610f82e527596642c5f5cd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,206,127,84,222,50,251,203,182,16,248,46,82,117,150,100,44,95,92,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
