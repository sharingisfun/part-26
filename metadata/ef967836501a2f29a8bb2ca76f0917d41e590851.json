Foucault begins to account for a current understanding of power and knowledge in a complex and multifaceted world that has not been adequately accounted for in current studies. The key advantage is that Foucault offers a transgressive approach that is not rooted in any single or systematic interpretation. The significence of the approach therefore lies in the fact that no one school of thought must be adopted in order to comprehend the importance of a particular action or development. Rather, the author intends to offer an integrative understanding that would be sufficient for a number of different approaches to international law and international relations.\n\n\nAbout the Author\nLeonard Hammer is Senior Lecturer at Zefat College, Israel.
