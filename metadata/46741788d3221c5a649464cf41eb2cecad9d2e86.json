Victor Mancini is a medical school dropout whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s taken a job playing an Irish indentured servant in a colonial-era theme park in order to help care for his AlzehimerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s-afflicted mother. Victor Mancini is a sex addict. Victor Mancini is a direct descendant of Jesus Christ. Welcome, once again, to the world of Chuck Palahniuk.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œArt never comes from happinessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says ManciniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mother only a few pages into the novel. Given her own dicey and melodramatic style of parenting, you would think that her sonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life would be chock full of nothing but art. Alas, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not the caseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in the fine tradition of Oedipus, Stephen Dedalus and Anthony Soprano, Victor hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite reconciled his issues with his mother. Instead, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trawling sexual-addiction recovery meetings for dates and purposely choking in restaurants for a few moments of attention. Longing for a hug, in other words, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s settling for the Heimlich.\n\nThematically, this is pretty familiar Palanhiuk territory. It would be a pity to disclose the surprises of the plot but suffice to say that what we have here is a little bit of Tom RobbinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Another Roadside Attraction, a little bit of Don DeLilloÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Day Room and, well, a little bit of Fight Club. Just as with that book and the other two novels under PalahniukÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s belt, we get a smattering of gloriously unflinching sound bites, such as this sceptical slight on prayer chains: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA spiritual pyramid scheme. As if you can gang up on God. Bully him around.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nWhether this is the novel that will break Palanhiuk into the mainstream is hard to say. For a fourth book, in fact, the ratio of iffy, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdudeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½-intensive dialogue to interesting and insightful passages is a little higher than we might wish. In the end though, the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nerve and daring pull the whole thing offÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½just. And whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s next for Victor ManciniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s creator? Leave the last word to him, declaring as he does on the final pages: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMaybe itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s our job to invent something better ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ What itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to be, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Bob Michaels, Amazon.com ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIF YOUÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢RE GOING TO READ THIS, DONÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢T BOTHER.\nAfter a couple pages, you wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to be here. So forget it. Go away. Get out while youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re still in one piece.\nSave yourself.\nThere has to be something better on television. Or since you have so much time on your hands, maybe you could take a night course. Become a doctor. You could make something out of yourself. Treat yourself to a dinner out. Color your hair.\nYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not getting any younger.\nWhat happens here is first going to piss you off. After that it just gets worse and worse.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46741788d3221c5a649464cf41eb2cecad9d2e86","amp;dn":"Choke+-+Chuck+Palahniuk+%282002%29+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46741788d3221c5a649464cf41eb2cecad9d2e86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,116,23,136,211,34,28,90,100,148,100,207,65,235,44,236,173,157,46,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
