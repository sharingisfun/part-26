Working out of their Laboratoire Plump studio in deepest, darkest Soho, the duo perfected its style with early singles &quot;The Push&quot; and &quot;No Way&quot; for Finger Lickin'. Along with Armand Van Helden and Ganja Kru, the pair remixed War for the Grooves &amp; Messages hits collection and found themselves being hyped by leading British DJs from radio (Pete Tong, Judge Jules) and the clubs (Fatboy Slim, Sasha). Remixes followed for Orbital, BT, Freestylers, and Elektronauts, and the full-length debut A Plump Night Out dropped in 2001.\n\n:Tracklist:\n\t\n01\tBest Believe Us\t\t\t3:07\n02\tSystem Addict\t\t\t5:25\n03\tShifting Gears\t\t\t2:48\n04\tSnake Eyes\t\t\t3:37\n05\tHe Got Beef\t\t\t4:41\n06\tIntermission\t\t\t2:11\n07\tTheme X\t\t\t \t3:38\n08\tSnafu\t\t\t \t4:37\n09\tBeat Myself Up\t\t\t4:20\n10\tDisco Unusual\t\t\t6:05\n11\tVictim\t\t\t \t4:50\n12\tRocket Soul\t\t\t5:45\n13\tTorque Of The Devil\t\t4:40\n14\tLost In Space\t\t\t4:15\n\n\n:File Info:\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nWriting library                          : LAME3.96r\nEncoding settings                        : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 20.5","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c8d7c3bd31c434f4f3d659753c3135c586d6095","amp;dn":"Plump.DJs-Headthrash.2008.320KBps-stevez","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c8d7c3bd31c434f4f3d659753c3135c586d6095","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,141,124,59,211,28,67,79,79,61,101,151,83,195,19,92,88,109,96,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
