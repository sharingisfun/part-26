Featuring\neveryone from Nils Frahm to Otto A Totland to Dustin OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Halloran and JÃƒÂ³hann\nJÃƒÂ³hannsson, it seems that Cedric managed to compile a universe of contemporary\nmusicians, showcasing some of their best works in one single swoop. We hope\nthat you enjoyed this three-part piano exploration, and as always, encourage\nyou to support the featured artists by purchasing their works!\n\n================================================================================\n\nCedric - Pianorama 2b\n\nWe begin part two exactly where we last left off Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with a Clark remix of a\ntrack by Nils Frahm dedicated to Peter Broderick - this mix was meant to be a\ncontinuous journey after all [a single file will be available after the third\npart is released]. Traversing styles and genres, Cedric delivers his second\ninstallment in the Pianoarama series, featuring many well known electronic\nmusicians, from Underworld to Four Tet to Bonobo to DJ Shadow and Deaf Center,\nleaving you mesmerized, just in time for part three... We hope that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll\nenjoy and support the many featured artists! Stay tuned for 2c going live next\nweek!\n\n================================================================================\n\nCedric - Pianorama 2a\n\nToday we kick off a three-part Pianorama mix series! Compiled by Cedric as a\nfollow up to his very first installment, the initial journey was just a bit\nover three hours long, and originally designed to be listened to in one\nsitting! After much discussion we decided to break up this odyssey into three\nparts, each section not surprisingly growing in the process even longer. And\nhere we are, presenting the first part, subtitled 2a, almost three months after\nthe initial conception! But enough about the process Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about the music\nafter all... We hope that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll enjoy and support the many featured artists!\nStay tuned for 2b going live next week!\n\n================================================================================\n\nRoel Funcken - Chronik Consoles\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique and incredibly enchanting about mixes by Roel Funcken is that he\ndoesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t simply select and lay out his favorite pieces Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he also manipulates\nthem into a gorgeous matrimony of sounds. As a long time producer and member of\nFunckarma (along with his brother Don), Funcken lightly applies minimal effects\nto already stunning collection of tracks, and dissipates all sudden spikes in\ntransition. This particular mix is full of beautiful music by the likes of\nRafael Anton Irisarri, Rival Consoles, Hior Chronik, Nils Frahm, Arovane,\nClark, Burial, Deaf Center and many of this other favorites... I recommend you\nlisten without the below tracklisting and see how many tracks you recognize...\nEnjoy!\n\nAnd much more, check the README for more information.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c13ba09843d60939ca1093c7ecab26efff3b22e6","amp;dn":"Headphone+commute+-+Mixes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c13ba09843d60939ca1093c7ecab26efff3b22e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,59,160,152,67,214,9,57,202,16,147,199,236,171,38,239,255,59,34,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
