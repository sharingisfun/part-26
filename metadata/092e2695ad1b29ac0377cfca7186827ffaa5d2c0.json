Readers far and wide will welcome this first full-length history (as opposed to guide) of Boston's architecture, from Charles Bulfinch to Walter Gropius. It is also the first Boston book that deals at some length with the Victorian suburbs as well as with the city proper, and that treats seriously not only late nineteenth-century design but also Boston's early Modernist architecture and its twentieth century Classical, Gothic, Colonial, and Art Deco buildings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:092e2695ad1b29ac0377cfca7186827ffaa5d2c0","amp;dn":"Built+in+Boston+-+City+and+Suburb+1800-1950+%28Architecture+Art+Eb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"092e2695ad1b29ac0377cfca7186827ffaa5d2c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,46,38,149,173,27,41,172,3,119,207,202,113,134,130,127,250,165,210,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
