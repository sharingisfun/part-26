Very Beautiful and very very easy. So do not expect noise.\n\nThanks to my imaginary &quot;Best Indie&quot; friend, I had a very nice weekend. It's nice to meet an idiot like myself. Some recognition maybe. Anyway we listened to some thousand songs. Most were beautiful, some clearly good and some were just to good to keep quiet. So I put these songs in my September lists (although most of them are a bit older but you might have missed them too). But whatever reason; in my ears, the list is quite special as it is. The songs really support each other. All in XHQ..... Enjoy,\n\n\n~@~ Indie 1309 I1 Friend Like You (Lo-Fi Pop)\n\n01 Julia Holter - World\n02 Sleeping At Last - Unmade\n03 Kashmir - Miss You\n04 Badly Drawn Boy - Pissing In The Wind\n05 Tyrone Wells - Looking At Her Face\n06 Richard Ashcroft - Sweet Brother\n07 Joshua Radin - Friend Like You\n08 The Honorary Title - Far More\n09 Julia Holter - In The Green Wild\n10 Dido - Me\n11 The Fray - Oh Come Emmanuel\n12 Kate Voegele - Hallelujah\n13 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - My Malakai\n14 Leona Naess - Christmas\n15 Embrace - Happiness Will Get\n16 Augustana - Boston\n17 Sleeping At Last - From The Ground Up\n18 City &amp; Colour - Day Old Hate\n19 Milow - Landslide\n20 Taylor Swift - State Of Grace\n21 Gary Jules - Falling Awake\n22 J.G.
