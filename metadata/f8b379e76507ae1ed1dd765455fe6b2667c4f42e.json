Meaning that you can progress past level 10000 now.. (Although I haven't tested it yet because I haven't made it to level 10000 yet)..\n\nStarting with version 1.0.13 the flash version requirements went from 11.7 to 11.2 so that it can be played on linux, however, just in case, in this cracked version the check for flash version has been disabled, meaning you can use any flash version, even pre-11.2..\n\nThe 3 versions differ in the following ways:\n\n~Normal (cracked) version~\nThere is nothing special about this version.. The only cheat it has is the &quot;Get more shadow cores&quot; button..\nUse this version if you want to play a normal non-cheating gemcraft campaign.. (Although of course premium stuff is still enabled..)\n\n~Soft-core Cheats version~\nThere is only one extra cheat in this version actually, which is: When ever your orb-tower thing takes damage, instead of subtracting from your mana, it ADDS to your mana.. Basically the logic is: If monsters are making it to your orb-tower, then you need more mana to help you..\nAlso note that enchanting your orb-tower to take less banishment actually works against you in this version, because the monsters will give you less mana when they attack your orb..\nThis version is for people who want to play gemcraft for a long time, but don't ever want to lose/die in the game, but still want to feel like they aren't cheating too much..\nAlso note: In endurance-mode, you can simple end the level by going to the menu and clicking on the &quot;End Endurance&quot; button.. It is safe.. It will still give you credit for how far you made it in endurance-mode, so don't worry..\n(Side note: Endurance-mode goes up to 999 waves)\n\n~Hard-core Cheats version~\nThis version DOES NOT include the cheat from soft-core cheats version.. Meaning, the enemies CAN hurt your orb-tower and CAN kill you..\nWhat this version DOES do though is: Any thing that usually costs mana to buy/use will not only not subtract from your mana any more, but it will GIVE you the associated mana cost to you.. (except for monsters attacking your orb)..\nEvery thing should be free to buy: Creating gems, towers, traps, amplifiers, gem-bombing, enraging waves, upgrading gems, duplicating gems, combining gems, et cetera..\nThis version is for people who are tired of playing gemcraft and just want to hurry up and beat it super fast so they can go back to having nothing to do any more and be bored every day waiting for the next gemcraft game to be released..\n\nI didn't combine the soft-core and hard-core cheats in to one version because it just seems to me like both of them combined are too much cheating.. It seems like some one who wants to use soft-core cheats wouldn't want to use hard-core.. And vice-versa.. So you have 3 options:\n1: Don't cheat at all..\n2: Be invincible but it will still take a long time to win..\n3: Be super powerful and can win quickly, but you can still die if you aren't careful..\n\nAlso, if you forget what the soft-core and hard-core versions do, on the main start screen, if you hover your mouse-cursor over the gray &quot;credits&quot; text at the bottom of the screen, it will tell you what those cheat versions do..\n\nThe optional shadow-core cheat works as follows (and is on all 3 versions):\nOn the map, you will now see a button that says &quot;Get more shadow cores&quot;.. Every time that you click on that you will instantly gain 128 shadow-cores.. You can click it as much as you desire.. The only problem is that the shadow-core display doesn't update instantly, so you have to go to other screens/places to see the updated amount.. But each time you click the button, it really is adding shadow-cores every time you hear that clicking sound..\nIf you don't want to cheat, then don't click that button..\n\n\nThe official change-log from version 1.0.16 is as follows:\n\n&gt; Fixed exploit: Venom shrines deal exact damage instead of hp ratio\n&gt; Towers don't fire at targets that are predicted to die by already incoming shots\n&gt; Field I1 hp increment fixed\n&gt; Field X5 should now have the death trigger properly placed beyond wave 99 if using traits or higher difficulty levels\n&gt; The Forgotten shouldn't engage the player after beating field X5 anymore\n&gt; The world map can be zoomed out farther\n&gt; Added to enhancement info panel: enhancements on gems in traps don't deplete\n&gt; Gem wasps seek targets in 1.2x higher range\n&gt; Fixed: Gems getting stuck if dragged while the Forgotten enrages waves\n&gt; Hopefully fixed: gems dealt less damage when playing at 9x speed + fast firing high grade gems hit a technical cap, limiting firing speed to 30 per sec\n&gt; The bloodbound component can't be amplified anymore, working now how poolbound already did\n\n\nAny way, have fun with this cracked gemcraft.. It will be years before the next gemcraft is released..\n\nLove and light,\nsigned your most bestest friend that you never had because you were too scared to talk to me when we passed by each other in real life that one day,\nokonomiyaki","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8b379e76507ae1ed1dd765455fe6b2667c4f42e","amp;dn":"Gemcraft+2+Chasing+Shadows+v1.0.16+Cracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8b379e76507ae1ed1dd765455fe6b2667c4f42e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,179,121,231,101,7,174,30,209,221,118,84,85,254,107,38,103,196,244,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
