Also known as the Mad King, Ludwig was deposed in 1886 after being declared insane by doctors who had never met him. He promptly diedÃ¢â‚¬â€mysteriously drowned in waist-deep waterÃ¢â‚¬â€his eccentric castles his only legacy.\n\nMaster of historical suspense Oliver PÃƒÂ¶tzsch brings the Mad King back to life in The Ludwig Conspiracy. An encoded diary by one of LudwigÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s confidants falls into the hands of modern-day rare book dealer Steven Lukas, who soon realizes that the diary may bring him more misery than money. Others want the diary as wellÃ¢â‚¬â€and they will kill to get it. Lukas teams up with a beautiful art detective, Sara Lengfeld, to investigate each of LudwigÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three famous castles for clues to crack the diaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s code as mysterious thugs and LudwigÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fanatical followers chase them at every step. Just what in the diary could be so explosive?\n\nCombining contemporary mystery and a gripping historical saga and centered on an ingenious code that can be cracked only with a combination of modern computers and nineteenth-century texts, The Ludwig Conspiracy is a bold new thriller from the best-selling author of The HangmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Daughter series.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre Reader ready.
