Roger Donaldson\nstarring . . . Bruno Lawrence, Anna Maria Monticelli, Greer Robson-Kirk\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083096/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083096/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFrom its opening sequence, Smash Palace is clearly something unusual. A car hurtles dangerously across the New Zealand countryside, moving so fast that the driver loses control of the vehicle and the car flips over. Who was the driver? As we soon discover, it doesn't matter, because this film isn't his story. Instead, it's about Al and Jacqui Shaw, who run the wrecking yard to which the damaged car is taken. Al and Jacqui live in the midst of acres of wrecked cars, in a dreary, isolated landscape that has taken its toll on their marriage. When Jacqui left France to join Al in this backwoods setting, she never dreamed life could turn so dismal so soon.\n\nOne of the dominant theories often discussed in regards to New Zealand film concerns the archetypal &quot;man alone&quot;, a term borrowed from John Mulgan's classic novel, which haunts so much of the early period of New Zealand cinema. In Smash Palace, Bruno Lawrence gives his first of several signature man alone performances, as Al slowly becomes more isolated from his wife and community, retreating to the solitude of his workshop and his cars.\n\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 716x480, 23.976 fps, 1540 Kbps, 01h48m11s\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\n\nDVDRip, English audio, separate English commentary track\n\nOptional subtitles in English, Serbian\n\ncover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/topn7iloz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/topn7iloz/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/oaquzyvyr/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/oaquzyvyr/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/x4hrh2ixf/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/x4hrh2ixf/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/dy4kdw2fn/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/dy4kdw2fn/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/kfngxecsz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/kfngxecsz/&lt;/a&gt;\n\ncredit ripper z. and source RL, October 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:781b4d00b5cd2ef52bd0f6e5a24486a79b25c889","amp;dn":"Smash+Palace+%5B1981+-+New+Zealand%5D+Kiwi+classic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"781b4d00b5cd2ef52bd0f6e5a24486a79b25c889","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,27,77,0,181,205,46,245,43,208,246,229,162,68,134,167,155,37,200,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
