Griffiths (PDF, 153 MiB)\n\n\nI couldn't find the fourth edition anywhere, so here it is for anyone else. The only significant difference between this and the third edition seems to be a few extra problems and a resultant renumbering of the exercises, which was unfortunately enough to require buying it. Sorry for the less-than-ideal scans; I would recommend using the third edition PDF (which already has torrents out there) for general reading and anything other than the exact exercises and numbering from the fourth. I don't have the fourth edition's solutions manual, but the one for the third edition covers almost all of the problems in this one (just be careful about matching up the actual problem and not the number).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c8f122caff1e7583cfb6deb1546e50857415e21","amp;dn":"David+J.+Griffiths+-+Introduction+to+Electrodynamics%2C+Fourth+Edi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c8f122caff1e7583cfb6deb1546e50857415e21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,143,18,44,175,241,231,88,60,251,109,235,21,70,229,8,87,65,94,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
