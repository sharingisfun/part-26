The album has spawned four singles so far: &quot;Mirrors&quot;, &quot;Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Free&quot;, and &quot;Kill My Boyfriend&quot;.  &quot;Mirrors&quot; was released on 10 August 2010 as the album's lead single. The song reached number seven in Austria, number ten in Germany and number fifty-two in Switzerland, as well as number three on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart\n      &quot;Activate My Heart&quot; was the second promotional single, released on 13 April 2010. The song, however, did not make the cut for the album.\n      Lewis Corner of Digital Spy rated the album four out of five stars, noting that &quot;a dark and electro-gothic soundscape flirts with Kills's metaphor-strewn lyrics and humorous quips&quot;, which are &quot;best showcased in 'Mirrors' and 'Zombie'&quot;. He continued: &quot;Each moment of pop surreality flourishes from Kills's own vision, then is finely tailored by some of the industry's most respected figuresÃ¢â‚¬â€the result as exciting as it is completely bonkers.&quot;  British magazine Star gave the album five stars and wrote that it is &quot;striking stuff and great moody pop to boot.&quot;  Jon O'Brien of Allmusic, giving Perfectionist three out of five stars, felt that &quot;there's something a little too calculated&quot; about the album, and that &quot;Kills appears to be more concerned with proving that she's all grown up than actually producing any music to back it up&quot;, concluding that &quot;Perfectionist is far too formulaic and gimmicky to live up to Kills' obvious maverick intentions.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f01bd5e2e6d87d60a1499b6cb94df8ccc995d18c","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+430","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f01bd5e2e6d87d60a1499b6cb94df8ccc995d18c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,27,213,226,230,216,125,96,161,73,155,108,185,77,248,204,201,149,209,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
