Make a wrong move at Forest Ridge Mall, and you\\'ll have to answer to no-nonsense security head Ronnie Barnhardt (Rogen). Ronnie sees skateboarders as the blight of society, and any shoplifter unfortunate enough to summon his wrath will be promptly busted and booked. Sure, Ronnie may suffer delusions of grandeur when it comes to his job, but perhaps with a little effort he\\'ll eventually get to trade in his flashlight and patch for a gun and a badge. When a flasher begins tormenting the shoppers at Forest Ridge Mall, Ronnie seizes the opportunity to showcase his detective skills and impress gorgeous makeup counter girl Brandi (Anna Faris), who can\\'t be bothered to give him a second glance. Perhaps by catching the culprit, Ronnie will finally earn himself a prized position over at the police academy. But the one thing Ronnie hadn\\'t counted on was competition, and when Detective Harrison (Ray Liotta) of the Conway Police makes it his personal mission to nab the flasher, the two rivals begin working around the clock to crack the case before their counterpart.\n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 27 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 688\n\nFrame Height: 288\n\nFrame Rate: 59fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 112kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:441d566998c49ac1b3b595b9da46856969b1e38b","amp;dn":"Observe+and+Report%282009%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"441d566998c49ac1b3b595b9da46856969b1e38b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,29,86,105,152,196,154,193,179,181,149,185,218,70,133,105,105,177,227,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
