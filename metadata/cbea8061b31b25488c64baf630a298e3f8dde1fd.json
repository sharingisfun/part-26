The next single, &quot;Rok the Nation,&quot; was almost as successful and the debut album Rob'n'Raz Feat. Leila K. was recorded in 1990, while the still-underage Leila K. was wanted by the police for running away from her parents. This made headline news, and while Rob'n'Raz were in charge, it was Leila K. who was the obvious star, with an uncompromising attitude and wild stories about her background. \nThe album was released and it was time for a major tour, but after only a few concerts, Leila K. disappeared. She was later found in Mallorca but then made it over to Ibiza where she arranged her own concerts to big success. Rob'n'Raz were sued over the failed tour and didn't want to know Leila K. anymore, who, upon her return, participated on Doktor Alban's hit &quot;Hello Africa&quot; and had two solo hits in 1991...
