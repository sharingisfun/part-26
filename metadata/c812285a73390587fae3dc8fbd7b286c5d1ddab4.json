Starting as a weekly in the mid-1920s, the magazine is now published 47 times per year, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. Although its reviews and events listings often focus on cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker has a wide audience outside of New York and USA. It is well known in its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric Americana; its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews; its rigorous fact checking and copyediting; its journalism on world politics and social issues; and its famous, single-panel cartoons sprinkled throughout each issue.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c812285a73390587fae3dc8fbd7b286c5d1ddab4","amp;dn":"The+New+Yorker+-+March+10th%2C+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c812285a73390587fae3dc8fbd7b286c5d1ddab4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,18,40,90,115,57,5,135,250,227,220,143,189,123,40,108,93,29,218,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
