It&amp;#039;s got a certain amount of filler and goofiness (like &quot;Jackin&amp;#039; For Beats,&quot; with Cube kicking it over a bunch of famous grooves), but it&amp;#039;s also got some great quick-cut music from Sir Jinx and the Bomb Squad, and two of the darkest, toughest, truest tracks Cube&amp;#039;s ever done: &quot;The Product,&quot; a scathing indictment of the system that destroys America&amp;#039;s underclass, and &quot;Dead Homies,&quot; a clear-eyed look at the aftermath of violence.
