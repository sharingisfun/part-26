Todd Rundgren is a soul man! Always has been, even when he was singing those rock n' roll songs at the top of his lungs (and range). In the tradition of Hall and Oates, two white blue-eyed soul brothers from Philadelphia, Mr. Rundgren uses vocal inflections to their ultimate effect. His technique never gets in the way but indeed enhances his ability to communicate the words he sings. The melodies are memorable and the arrangements pure magic. There are no throwaways, every song given the attention of Todd's best epics...\n(review, amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nTodd Rundgren - 2nd Wind\n(Warner Bros WEA 1991)\n\n 1. Change Myself   \n 2.
