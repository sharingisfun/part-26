Need for Speed: Underground 2 provides several new features, such as a broader customization, new methods of selecting races, the &quot;explore&quot; mode (just driving around freely, like the Midnight Club series, in a large city known as &quot;Bayview&quot;). Underground 2 also introduces several SUVs, which could be customized as extensively as other Underground 2 vehicles and used to race against other SUV racers.
