It was emblematic of his work in that era ? unpredictable, experimental, restless, sometimes remarkable, sometimes more noteworthy for what was being attempted than presented. GRP's recently reissued CD includes a great bonus cut, the nearly 12-minute &quot;Number One&quot; with surging, raw Coltrane tenor contrasted by Pharoah Sanders' piccolo and flute. But while the new material was valuable, the compelling cut here remains &quot;To Be,&quot; the 16-minute-plus Coltrane/Sanders dialogue on flutes and piccolo. It was the only time on record that Coltrane played flute (at least for any lengthy period), and his singing lines, blend of raspy and lyrical phrases and overall approach were as identifiable on that instrument as any of his saxes. \n \n\n\n \n       1  Ogunde  Coltrane  3:36  \n       2  To Be  Coltrane  16:20  \n       3  Offering  Coltrane  8:25  \n       4  Expression  Coltrane  10:50  \n       5  Number One  Coltrane  11:55  \n\n\n   njoy :)\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:256052c4dc54bf1d8e728308361b5b721da683f8","amp;dn":"JAZZ+-+John+Coltrane+-+Expression%281967++320kps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"256052c4dc54bf1d8e728308361b5b721da683f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,96,82,196,220,84,191,29,142,114,131,8,54,27,91,114,29,166,131,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
