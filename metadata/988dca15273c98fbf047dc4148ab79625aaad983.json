With SupermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help, they discover that the girl is Kara Zor-El, the niece of Jor-El and Superman/Kal-ElÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biological cousin. While Superman welcomes Kara with open arms and teaches her English and how to behave in society, Batman remains suspicious. \n\nTipped off by Batman, Wonder Woman and Lyla ambush Clark Kent and Kara in a park and take Kara to Themyscira, on the basis that only there can she learn to control her powers. Superman reluctantly agrees, but still prefers to watch over Kara himself. Elsewhere, on the planet Apokolips, Darkseid learns of KaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presence on Earth, and orders her to be captured and brought to Apokolips as a possible candidate to lead the Female Furies since the departure of Big Barda.\n\n\nThis is the source of the file:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://hardcorelearner.com/in-english/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://hardcorelearner.com/in-english/&lt;/a&gt;\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:988dca15273c98fbf047dc4148ab79625aaad983","amp;dn":"ENGLISH+FOR+BADASSES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"988dca15273c98fbf047dc4148ab79625aaad983","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,141,202,21,39,60,152,251,240,71,220,65,72,171,121,98,90,170,217,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
