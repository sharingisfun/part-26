It is mentioned over 300 times in the Bible (and it is even mentioned three times in the family tree of our Lord Jesus Christ!) This is, of course, the fabled Babylon.\n\nIt was founded by the first world dictator, Nimrod, and it may well be destined to be the capital of the final world dictator, commonly called the Antichrist! And this may all be emerging on our near horizon.\n\nThis study contains 2 hours of teachings\n\n\n\nKabbalah And The Rise Of Mysticism:\n\n&quot;Whether disillusioned by the self-imposed blinders and myopia of contemporary &quot;science,&quot; or frustrated by the moral bankruptcy of unbridled materialism, increasing numbers of desperate people are now seeking &quot;answers&quot; outside the realm of natural phenomena and are pursuing the supernatural. The anguished plea of the disenfranchised now begs the question, &quot;Is there anyone out there?&quot;\n\nBeyond the beguiling allure of many contemporary forms of ancient paganism, such as the New Age, Wicca, and others, many people have become attracted to a form of Hebrew mysticism known as Kabbalah. The popular press is speckled with articles of prominent Hollywood personalities who have taken up a popular contemporary version of Kabbalah\n\nIThis briefing pack contains 2 hours of teachings\n\n\nThe Magog Invasion:\n\nFor many years we have been following the conventional view of Ezekiel 38 and 39. With the growing tensions between Iran and Israel, these passages are the subject of much current debate. However, the conventional view still leaves a number of puzzling inconsistencies and contradictions. Ezekiel 38 indicates that Israel is dwelling safely and ''without walls.'' Yet, with walls being built and missiles landing each day Israel is hardly dwelling in peace. This leaves us with a puzzling anomaly: the players listed in Ezekiel seen to exclude any of the bordering nations: Where are the Palestinians? The Lebanese? The Syrians? The Iraqis? The Jordanians? The Egyptians?\n\nThis study is approxmately 120 minutes in length\n\n\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long.\n \n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad0ec0f5a34c136609d24449616a27b1b811439b","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Chuck+Missler+-+Mystery+of+Babylon+-+Magog+Invasion+-+Ka","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad0ec0f5a34c136609d24449616a27b1b811439b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,14,192,245,163,76,19,102,9,210,68,73,97,106,39,177,184,17,67,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
