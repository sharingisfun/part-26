Although already noted for his short works, especially the scandalous SHOULD I KILL THEM?, Bianchi clearly threw down a political and aesthetic gauntlet with this provocative, kaleidoscopic journey through contemporary Brazil that measures the distance between the radical slogans of the Sixties and the grim realities of the Eighties. In the film, Antonio CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar exists mainly as a televisual image, a ghostly presence that continues to haunt these characters and yet seems safely distant and contained - an apt metaphor for the legacy of the Sixties in politics, art and cinema for a generation of Brazilians just then awakening to a new democracy. \n\n\nSubtitles english (.srt)\n\n\nContainer: AVI\nVideo Codec: XVID\nVideo Bitrate: 878 Kbps\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Codec: MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Bitrate: 106\nResolution: 672x416\nAspect Ratio: 1.615\nFrame Rate: 23.976\nSize: 700.6 MiB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c476364983f2fa83d0e4840903efb6f1e749d44","amp;dn":"Romance+-+S%C3%83%C2%A9rgio+Bianchi+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c476364983f2fa83d0e4840903efb6f1e749d44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,71,99,100,152,63,47,168,61,14,72,64,144,62,251,111,30,116,157,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
