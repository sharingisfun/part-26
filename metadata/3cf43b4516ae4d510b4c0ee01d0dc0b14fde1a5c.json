It was published in 2002 by DC Comics' Wildstorm imprint.\n\nThe series followed the life of Automatic Kafka, an android who had been a member of a mass-marketed superhero group called the $tranger$ during the 1980s. After the team breaks up, Kafka is lost, looking for a new direction in life. The comic follows Kafka as he tries different ways of becoming human: drugs, sex and fame among them. The series also visits Kafka's former teammates who each have adapted to their life post-$tranger$ in their own way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cf43b4516ae4d510b4c0ee01d0dc0b14fde1a5c","amp;dn":"AUTOMATIC+KAFKA+01-09+%282002-2003%29+Complete+%28DC+Wildstorm%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cf43b4516ae4d510b4c0ee01d0dc0b14fde1a5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,244,59,69,22,174,77,81,11,76,14,224,29,13,192,177,79,222,26,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
