Before launching his own solo career with his 1998 album &quot;Velvet&quot;, Standring represented a third of the band SolarSystem, a one-shot project that combined elements of jazz and hip-hop.\n\nChris Standring was born and raised in Buckinghamshire, England; classically trained at the London College of Music, he further honed his skills during a decade spent working for the BBC as well as a number of theatrical orchestras on London's West End. From there Standring relocated to Los Angeles, where he became a top session player after recording with everyone from Bebe &amp; Cece Winans to Jody Watley to Carole Bayer Sager; in 1996, he also teamed with keyboardist Rodney Lee to helm the acid jazz combo SolarSystem. After touring for a year and a half with trumpeter Rick Braun, Standring issued his solo debut Velvet in 1999, scoring the smooth jazz radio hit &quot;Cool Shades&quot;; Hip Sway appeared a year later. Groovalicious came next (2003) followed by Soul Express (2006). Love &amp; Paragraphs (2008) spawned the title track hit radio single.\n\nLos Angeles-based British expatriate guitarist Chris Standring's eclectic collection of smooth jazz instrumentals contains elements of acid jazz on songs like &quot;A Method to the Madness&quot; and &quot;Shooting Stars,&quot; silky R&amp;B on &quot;I Can't Help Myself,&quot; ... Full Descriptionand electronica on the dreamy &quot;Kaleidoscope.&quot; Standring's fluid, accessible style recalls George Benson at his jazz crossover best, while compositions like &quot;Giant Steps&quot; and &quot;Constellation&quot; are high-quality chill-out mood music.\n\nRelease Date: May 09, 2006\nStudio/Live: Studio\nMono/Stereo: Stereo\nProducer: Chris Standring; Paul Brown; Rodney Lee\nEngineer: Chris Standring; Rodney Lee\nRecording Time: 52 minutes\n\nPersonnel:\n\nPaul Brown - percussion\nRoberto Vally\nDino Soldo - harmonica\nDave Karasony - drums\nChris Standring - guitars, vocoder, keyboard programming\nStan Sargent - acoustic bass\nAndre Berry - bass guitar\nC.
