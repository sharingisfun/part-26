Turn on the news today and you will hear numerous reports of conflicts and problems across the globe. Listen for very long, and it becomes obvious that tensions surrounding the tiny country of Israel are among the top stories.\n\nUsing events happening before our eyes, Pastor Kevin Lea analyzes the meaning behind two of the most interesting and dire prophecies of the Bible. Found in Isaiah 17 and Psalm 83, these prophecies describe a devastating conflict in the Middle East between Israel and her neighbors.\n\nIsaiah 17:1 says &quot;Behold, Damascus will cease from being a city, and it will be a ruinous heap.&quot;\n\nWith ancient hatred of the Jews continuing to our day, war in the Middle East has happened before and is expected to happen again. But the city of Damascus made a ruinous heap? With modern weaponry and current tensions, this Biblical prophecy has never seemed so close to fulfillment.\n\nJoin Pastor Kevin in this two part study as he explores the timing and circumstances of the conflict that sparks this terrible judgment on Damascus and will change the world.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMAYHEM IN THE MIDDLE EAST with Guest Avi Lipkin:\nAvi breaks down current middle-east events and the global problems facing the Muslim faith.

These enemies of Israel are depicted on the red arrows upon the book cover image, and their mandate is clear: They have said, &quot;Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation, That the name of Israel may be remembered no more.&quot; (Psalm 83:4). Psalm 83 predicts a climactic, concluding Arab-Israeli war that has eluded the discernment of today's top Bible scholars, and yet, the Middle East stage appears to be set for the fulfillment of this prophecy. While many of today's top Bible experts are predicting that Russia, Iran, Turkey, Libya, and several other countries are going to invade Israel according to the prophecy in Ezekiel 38, this timely book explains how Psalm 83 occurs prior. Discover how Israel defeats their ancient Arab enemies, and why Americans need to stand beside Israel in this coming war! This book is an updated version of Isralestine, The Ancient Blueprints of the Future Middle East, which was written by the same author. This updated version includes over 17 new chapters and appendices.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Future of the Middle East...
