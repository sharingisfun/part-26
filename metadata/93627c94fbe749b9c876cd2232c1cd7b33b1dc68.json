You look out for number one, and no one knows that better than Ty. Sheâ€™s been surviving on the factory line as long as she can remember. But now Ty has Colin. Sheâ€™s no longer alone; itâ€™s the two of them against the world. Thatâ€™s something even a town this brutal canâ€™t take away from her. Until it does.\r\n\r\nLenaâ€™s future depends on her familyâ€™s factory, a beast that demands a ruthless master, and Lena is prepared to be as ruthless as it takes if it means finally proving herself to her father. But when a chance encounter with Colin, a dreamer despite his circumstances, exposes Lena to the consequences of her actions, sheâ€™ll risk everything to do whatâ€™s right.\r\n\r\nIn Lena, Ty sees an heiress with a chip on her shoulder. Colin sees something more. In a world of disease and war, tragedy and betrayal, allies and enemies, all three of them must learn that challenging what they thought was true can change all the rules.\r\n\r\nAn enthralling story of friendship and rebellion, Metaltown will have you believing in the power of hope","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93627c94fbe749b9c876cd2232c1cd7b33b1dc68","amp;dn":"Metaltown+by+Kristen+Simmons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93627c94fbe749b9c876cd2232c1cd7b33b1dc68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,98,124,148,251,231,73,185,200,118,205,34,50,193,205,123,51,177,220,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
