It features an ensemble cast. Set in the London criminal underworld, the movie contains two intertwined plots ÃƒÂ¢ one dealing with the search for a stolen diamond, the other with a small-time boxing promoter named Turkish (Statham) who finds himself under the thumb of a psychotic gangster named Brick Top (Ford).\n\nThe film is characterised by an assortment of colourful characters, including the &quot;pikey&quot; Irish Traveller Mickey O&amp;#039;Neil (Pitt), Uzbek ex-KGB agent and arms-dealer Boris &amp;#039;the Blade&amp;#039; Yurinov (or Boris the Bullet-Dodger, and Boris The Sneaky Fucking Russian) (Ãƒâ€¦ erbedÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ija), professional thief-gambling addict Frankie &amp;#039;Four-Fingers (del Toro) and bounty hunter Bullet-Tooth Tony (Jones). It is also distinguished by a kinetic direction and editing style, a circular plot featuring numerous ironic twists of chance and causality, and a fast pace.\n\nThe movie shares similar themes, ideas and motifs as Ritchie&amp;#039;s first film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. It is also filmed in the same visual style and features many of the same actors, including Vinnie Jones, Jason Statham and Jason Flemyng, who appears in a minor role as one of the &amp;#039;pikeys&amp;#039;. It has been noted by some critics that Snatch bears a resemblance to the 1994 film Pulp Fiction; both deal with underworld criminals, very valuable items (the glowing case in Pulp Fiction and the diamond in Snatch), and boxers (Butch, Bruce Willis, in Pulp Fiction; and Mickey, Brad Pitt).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c22e4b269d36711098688860d9879eb8f7fd0c4","amp;dn":"SNATCH+-+%5BENG%5D%5B2000%5D+-+LIBRE+%26+VERITAS+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c22e4b269d36711098688860d9879eb8f7fd0c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,34,228,178,105,211,103,17,9,134,136,134,13,152,121,235,143,127,208,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
