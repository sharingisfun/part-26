Alongside fundamental topics, such as crystal defects, phase transformations and statistical thermodynamics, the team of international authors treats such hot areas as nano-size effects, interfaces, and spintronics, as well as technical applications of modern alloys, like data storage and recording, and the possibilities offered by materials design.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9704945e77b6b955c3d3f218b4275a6fa8023b0","amp;dn":"Alloy+Physics%3A+A+Comprehensive+Reference","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9704945e77b6b955c3d3f218b4275a6fa8023b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,112,73,69,231,123,107,149,92,61,63,33,139,66,117,166,250,128,35,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
