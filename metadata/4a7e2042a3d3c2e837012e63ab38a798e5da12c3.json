She acquired her first fans when she won the first prize in a children's song contest and following this initial success, her parents allowed her to join the girl trio Arabesque as lead singer and, Sandra was 16 at the time, signed a contract on her behalf.\nArabesque proved to be as successful in Japan as Abba was in Europe at that time. In 1985 the band split and Sandra started working with her boyfriend Michael Cretu whom she later married.\nIn the summer of 1985 Sandra released Maria Magdalena. The record became a massive hit. It reached No. 1 of the sales charts in 21 countries and Top 10 positions in 5 other countries.\nThis enormous success was followed by Sandra's first solo album The Long Play (1985) and she continued with a string of very successful album releases:\nMirrors (1986), Ten On One (1987), Into A Secret Land (1988), Paintings In Yellow (1990), Greatest Hits (1992), Close To Seven (1994), Fading Shades (1995), My Favourites (1999) and the most recent album The Wheel Of Time which was released in 2002.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/xoD7WRv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/xoD7WRv.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01.
