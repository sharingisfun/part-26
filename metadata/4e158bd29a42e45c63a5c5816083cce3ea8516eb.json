On that album were the minor hits &quot;Talkin&amp;#039; Seattle Grunge Rock Blues&quot;, a folk song about the early &amp;#039;90&amp;#039;s grunge scene, featuring a band that &quot;refused to play&quot;, and &quot;Alright Guy&quot;, which later became the title cut of Gary Allan&amp;#039;s 2001 album.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.toddsnider.net/home.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.toddsnider.net/home.html&lt;/a&gt;\n-----------------------------------------\nLyrics:\n&quot;(chorus)\nhey, hey, my, my\nrock and roll will never die\nhang your hair down in your eye\nyou&amp;#039;ll make a million dollars\n\nwell i was in this band goin&amp;#039; nowhere fast\nwe sent out demos but everybody passed\nso one day we finally took the plunge\nmoved out to seattle to play some grunge\nwashington state that is\nspace needle\neddie vedder\nmudhoney\n\nnow to fit in fast we wear flannel shirts\nwe turn our amps up until it hurts\nwe&amp;#039;ve got bad attitudes and what&amp;#039;s more\nwhen we play we stare straight down at the floor\nwowee\npretty scary\nhow pensive\nhow totally alternative\n\nnow to fit in on the seattle scene\nyou&amp;#039;ve gotta do somethin&amp;#039; they ain&amp;#039;t never seen\nso thinkin&amp;#039; up a gimmick one day\nwe decided to be the only band that wouldn&amp;#039;t play a note\nunder any circumstances\nsilence\nmusic&amp;#039;s original alternative\nroot&amp;#039;s grunge\n\nwell we spread the word through the underground\nthat we were the hottest new thing in town\nthe record guy came out to see us one day\nand just like always we didn&amp;#039;t play\nit knocked him out\nhe said he loved our work\nhe said he loved our work but he wasn&amp;#039;t sure if he could sell a record\nwith nothing on it\ni said tell &amp;#039;em we&amp;#039;re from seattle\nhe advanced us two and a half million dollars\n\n(chorus)\n\nwell they made us do a video but that wasn&amp;#039;t tough\n&amp;#039;cuz we just filmed ourselves smashin&amp;#039; stuff\nit was kinda weird &amp;#039;cuz there was no music\nbut mtv said they&amp;#039;d love to use it\n\nthe kids went wild, the kids went nuts\nrolling stone gave us a five-star review said we played with guts\nwe&amp;#039;re scorin&amp;#039; chicks, takin&amp;#039; drugs\nthen we got asked to play mtv unplugged\nyou should have seen it\nwe went right out there and refused to do acoustical versions of the\nelectrical songs we had refused to record in the first place\nthen we smashed our shit\n\nwell we blew &amp;#039;em away at the grammy&amp;#039;s show\nby refusing to play and refusing to go\nand then just when we thought fame would last forever\nalong come this band that wasn&amp;#039;t even together\nnow that&amp;#039;s alternative\nnow that&amp;#039;s alternative to alternative\ni feel stupid\nand contagious\n\nwell our band got dropped and that ain&amp;#039;t funny\n&amp;#039;cuz we&amp;#039;re all hooked on drugs but we&amp;#039;re outta money\nso the other day i called up the band\ni said boys i&amp;#039;ve taken all i can\nshave off your goatees\npack the van\nwe&amp;#039;re goin&amp;#039; back to athens&quot;\n----------------------------------------\n\nRipped by Big Brother\nFirst posted on www.thepiratebay.se\n\nTeam 1984 \nYour best source for:\n    Rare/Out of Print music\n    Audio/Video Bootlegs\n    Old/Out of Print Software\n    Counter-culture books/text\n    Off the beaten path movies\n    Weird Porn\n    Anything else that we dig..\n\nTeam 1984 doesn&amp;#039;t do mainstream\n          doesn&amp;#039;t follow the herd\n          are just some stoned hippies\n                     with attitude\n\nWant to be a member of Team 1984?\nSimple, \n    Just include this NFO\n             and\n    Don&amp;#039;t up anything lame/mainstream\n\nHails to:\n   freakyflicks, Fat Fuck Frank, sickboy88\n   splattergod, ChrisGoes, Bob Dylan\n\nFuck Off to:\n    RIAA, MPAA, Viacom, Metallica\n              ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e158bd29a42e45c63a5c5816083cce3ea8516eb","amp;dn":"Todd+Snider+-+Talkin%5C%27+Seattle+Grunge+Rock+Blues+CD+single","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e158bd29a42e45c63a5c5816083cce3ea8516eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,21,139,210,154,66,228,92,99,165,197,129,96,131,204,227,234,133,22,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
