Engineered For Flexibility\r\n\r\n modo was engineered to meet the challenges of the increasing demands of film, gaming, television, print and many other markets. modo combines a highly advanced real-time subdivision surface engine, fast, flexible and extensible modeling tools, and one of the most innovative and flexible user interfaces ever created. Due to the flexible nature of the modo toolset and interface, modo is excellent for creating models of any type. From organics to hard surfaces, from high-resolution film models to low-resolution real-time meshes, modo has the tools you need. Built For Artists modo was created to fill a void in the production world. Today's 3D modelers require a much more robust set of modeling tools, within a real-time environment, designed specifically for manipulating subdivision surfaces. modo delivers this toolset in an architecture that is designed with expansion in mind. This allows artists to create more detailed models, in an interactive environment, in a shorter timeline. modo's customizable nature allows these advanced artists to sculpt the toolset to their production requirements so that productivity can jump to new levels once the artist is fully established in the modo environment.\r\n \nhttps://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/modo/\r\n\r\nInstall Notes (crack):\r\n----------------------\r\n1.
