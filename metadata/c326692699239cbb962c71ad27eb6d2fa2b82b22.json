This unity of purpose, in one district, is undermined by two families, feuding since the head of one shot the head of the other twenty years before. There are hopes of a reconciliation through a marriage of Pan Tadeusz, a Soplica, whose father, the murderer, is in hiding somewhere, and Zosia, a teen-aged girl, a Horeszko who lives in the household of Pan's uncle. Other cross-currents - of love, family, politics, village traditions, land reform, and what it means to be Polish - give the film texture. It's an exile's story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c326692699239cbb962c71ad27eb6d2fa2b82b22","amp;dn":"Pan+Tadeusz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c326692699239cbb962c71ad27eb6d2fa2b82b22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,38,105,38,153,35,156,187,150,44,113,173,39,235,109,47,162,184,43,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
