The conversations were between pilots and other individuals on the flight and various individuals in Washington DC on the flight back from Dallas to Andrews Air Force Base. It is two hours and 22 minutes long.\n\nThe Raab Collection recently discovered two Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ open reel audio tapes containing identical excerpts from the Air Force One flight on Nov. 22, 1963 among the papers and other memorabilia of Army General Chester &quot;Ted&quot; Clifton, Jr.. General Clifton served as senior military aide to President John F. Kennedy, and had received the tapes from the White House Communications Agency (WHCA). The original audio tape recording is described as &quot;Radio Traffic involving AF-1 in flight from Dallas, Texas to Andrews AFB on November 22, 1963&quot;.\n\nThe conversations were captured by the WHCA, which routed all phone calls and radio traffic. The tape also includes communication between the WHCA and a second aircraft of the Presidential fleet, known as 86972 (by its tail number), which was en route to Tokyo at the time of the assassination with members of the President's cabinet.\n\nThe recording includes references to new code names and incidents. Among them are a private conversation by head of the Secret Service Jerry Behn about the disposition of the President's body; an expanded conversation about how to remove the body from the plane and where to take it; an urgent effort by an aide to Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay to reach General Clifton; and attempts to locate various Congressmen from Texas.\n\nThe National Archives Lyndon Johnson Presidential Library has a different version of the recording, and is approximately 40 minutes shorter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d392dd128f526ad4e9687516346c3bd5409902e","amp;dn":"Radio+Traffic+involving+AF-1+in+flight+reel+1+November+22%2C+1963","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d392dd128f526ad4e9687516346c3bd5409902e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,57,45,209,40,245,38,173,78,150,135,81,99,70,195,189,84,9,144,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
