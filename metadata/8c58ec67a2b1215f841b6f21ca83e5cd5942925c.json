They are a reclusive band and not much is known about them. In concert they incorporate lots of visuals and jamming/improvisation. They have diverse influences including post-rock obviously but also classic prog, ambient, noise rock and math rock. Their use of improvisation has had them compared to KING CRIMSON while their use of spacey atmospheres has had them compared to PINK FLOYD.\n\nBio by Darryl (zravkapt). -Progarchives\n\nTorrent:\n\n2009 - Eye (@ 320Kbps)\n2012 - Willow Spree (@ 320Kbps)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c58ec67a2b1215f841b6f21ca83e5cd5942925c","amp;dn":"Mescaliner+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c58ec67a2b1215f841b6f21ca83e5cd5942925c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,88,236,103,162,177,33,95,132,27,111,33,202,131,229,205,89,66,146,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
