When the boss retaliates by kidnapping his sister, Lola, a rescue attempt by LeÃƒÂ¯to is destroyed by betrayal that gets him arrested and Lola kept in the clutches in Taha.

Now with time running out, Damien and LeÃƒÂ¯to must work together to find and stop the bomb, but there is far more to this crisis than any of the field players realize.\n\nAlso starring Gisele Casadesus, Maurane and Patrick Bouchitey.\n\nFrom France, in French \n\nSubtitles by SBS AU TV\n\nPlease seed\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64fc6dec0ad3a65b49a4a161ecb5c490b68e21c1","amp;dn":"District+B13+Eng+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64fc6dec0ad3a65b49a4a161ecb5c490b68e21c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,252,109,236,10,211,166,91,73,164,161,97,236,181,196,144,182,142,33,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
