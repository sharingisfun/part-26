The entire world is a manhole cover-type disk that covers the back of a giant that is swimming through outer space. DISCWORLD, the game, relates the tale of an apprentice wizard named Rincewind (voiced by Eric Idle of MONTY PYTHON fame). Rincewind has just been chosen by Unseen University's chancellor to take a special mission. Unfortunately, the mission is quite dangerous and requires defeating a dragon. Take control of Rincewind and use a point-and-click interface to solve puzzles and keep the dragon from destroying all of Discworld. You will be amazed by the beautiful hand-drawn animation that illustrates the story. Play DISCWORLD and see if Rincewind will survive to make a sequel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9eab94ae13149209616e9b0f8d0a58ec479de032","amp;dn":"%28PSX-PSP%29+Discworld+converted+properly+%28Kingdom-games+by+KloWn%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9eab94ae13149209616e9b0f8d0a58ec479de032","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,171,148,174,19,20,146,9,97,110,155,15,141,10,88,236,71,157,224,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
