Seven of the album's nine songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Bon Scott. &quot;Can I Sit Next to You Girl&quot; was written by Angus &amp; Malcolm Young prior to Scott's involvement in the band, and &quot;School Days&quot; is a cover version of a Chuck Berry song.\n\nT.N.T. was originally released on Albert Productions, and has never been reissued by another label. However, most of its contents were included on Atlantic Records' High Voltage album, which was released internationally in May 1976.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \n\n    &quot;It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:15\n    &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Singer&quot;                                    Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:04\n    &quot;The Jack&quot;                                                Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:52\n    &quot;Live Wire&quot;                                               Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:49\n    &quot;T.N.T.&quot;                                                  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:34\n    &quot;Rocker&quot;                                                  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:49\n    &quot;Can I Sit Next to You Girl&quot;                              Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:12\n    &quot;High Voltage&quot;                                            Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:22\n    &quot;School Days&quot; (Chuck Berry)                               Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:23\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40d3f235bf90a929e1db897f29189f0117e93e75","amp;dn":"AcDc+-+1976+-+T.N.T.+%28Australia+only%29+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40d3f235bf90a929e1db897f29189f0117e93e75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,211,242,53,191,144,169,41,225,219,137,127,41,24,159,1,23,233,62,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
