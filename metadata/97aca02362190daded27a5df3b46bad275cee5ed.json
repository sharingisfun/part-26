Ryan's &quot;The Adolescence of P-1&quot; but\nit's a very loose interpretation.  The novel involves\nnuclear weapons and underground bunkers, whereas the film\ninvolves a nuclear power plant and a high school classroom. \nAnd a teen hangout pizza shop.  Well, at least they got most\nof the names right!\n\nThere's a lot of talk about how this film and its parent\nbook are the earliest &quot;Machine outthinks its maker&quot; concept\nbut that's not true... that happened as far back as the\noriginal Star Trek series and some early Asimov novels, and\na lot of other places.  It's not an original idea in print\nor on film.\n\nBut don't get me wrong... I don't dislike this little gem!\nIt's klunky, but I love it for the stereotypes and\nnostalgia, not to mention the rooms full of shiny new\nCommodore 64 and PET computers.\n\nI'm setting up a torrent for this because I saw someone\nstart one of an avi recently and the quality, based on his\nscreen caps, is a lot lower than it is here, and I mean both\nthe compression and the original source video quality.  This\nis a recording of a pristine factory VHS done with a studio\nquality DVD recorder.  The quality is excellent.  Three\nscreen caps are included in the torrent.\n\nThis is a standard DVD with a main menu and a chapter\nselection menu.  I hope you enjoy it.\n\nFunnybook\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97aca02362190daded27a5df3b46bad275cee5ed","amp;dn":"Hide+and+Seek+%281983%29+DVD+%28The+Adolescence+of+P-1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97aca02362190daded27a5df3b46bad275cee5ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,172,160,35,98,25,13,173,237,39,165,223,59,70,186,210,117,206,229,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
