Upon first hearing these jingles, listeners will be amazed to find themselves singing along spontaneously, and surprised at how they come back to full consciousness in spite of not having been heard (most of them) for decades. That said, it's great fun to hear most of these commercials dealing with food, cigarettes, household cleaners, beer, cars, and soft drinks, among other products. Within the history of these ads, listeners hear the voices of personalities such as Edie Adams and Dinah Shore. Also, included is the original Coke commercial that led to the pop hit &quot;I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing.&quot; Some might quibble with the fact that not all of these commercials appear to be the originals, but they still bring back memories that have stayed with listeners despite themselves. There may even be heavy sociological implications within the confines of the jingles, but listeners can forget that and simply enjoy the hooks that abound in such classic ads as &quot;A Little Dab'll Do Ya&quot; from Brylcreem, &quot;Plop, Plop Fizz&quot; from Alka Seltzer, &quot;Snap, Crackle, Pop&quot; from Rice Krispies, &quot;Nobody Doesn't Like Sara Lee,&quot; and so forth. A great album for trivia buffs and couch potatoes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40c8ea6b602fb0a34117046aefc290916b89713a","amp;dn":"TeeVee+Toons+-+The+Commercials+%2855+Famous+Ads%29+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40c8ea6b602fb0a34117046aefc290916b89713a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,200,234,107,96,47,176,163,65,23,4,106,239,194,144,145,107,137,113,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
