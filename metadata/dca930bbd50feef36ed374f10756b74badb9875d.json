A perfect introduction for new readers and a must-have for avid fans, this New York Times Notable Book includes &quot;Bloodchild,&quot; winner of both the Hugo and the Nebula awards and &quot;Speech Sounds,&quot; winner of the Hugo Award. Appearing in print for the first time, &quot;Amnesty&quot; is a story of a woman named Noah who works to negotiate the tense and co-dependent relationship between humans and a species of invaders. Also new to this collection is &quot;The Book of Martha&quot; which asks: What would you do if God granted you the abilityÃ¢â‚¬â€and responsibilityÃ¢â‚¬â€to save humanity from itself?\nLike all of Octavia ButlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best writing, these works of the imagination are parables of the contemporary world. She proves constant in her vigil, an unblinking pessimist hoping to be proven wrong, and one of contemporary literatureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strongest voices.\n\n\nOctavia E. Butler's classic &quot;Bloodchild,&quot; winner of both the Nebula and Hugo awards, anchors this collection of incomparable stories and essays. &quot;Bloodchild&quot; is set on a distant planet where human children spend their lives preparing to become hosts for the offspring of the alien Tlic. Sometimes the procedure is harmless, but often it is not. Also included is the Hugo Award - winning &quot;Speech Sounds,&quot; about a near future in which humans must adapt after an apocalyptic event robs them of their ability to speak. In this audiobook, Butler shows us life on Earth and amongst the stars, telling her tales with characteristic imagination and clarity. \n\n\n\n\nWritten by: Octavia E.
