Expecting that they would face Zabuza again, Kakashi decides to take Team 7 to the woods to teach them chakra control by having them walk up a tree by infusing chakra into their feet. While Sakura got it on the first try, both Naruto and Sasuke had to attempt it numerous times with Kakashi seeing Naruto asking Sakura for advice. Elsewhere, revealed to be Zabuza's follower, the masked youth known as Haku tends to Zabuza's wounds as the swordsman intends to settle things with Kakashi once fully healed within a week's time.
