In 2007's Counting Heads, a rocket ship crash, apparently sabotage, killed powerful financier Eleanor Starke and left her adult daughter, Ellen, gravely injured. Ellen, whose damaged head has been grafted onto the body of an infant, insists her mother is still alive, an apparent delusion that complicates her efforts to assert control over the family business empire. As clones and artificial intelligences begin to redefine humanity and sentience, powerful executives derail a space colonization plan for their own profit. While newcomers might wish for a short prologue or a glossary, those omissions don't significantly detract. With ambitious narrative scope and small moments of perfect prose, this tale of 22nd-century politics repays the close reading necessary to follow its many interweaving plots","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f294a1f094fbfb60a843d95840654bcd23d0b858","amp;dn":"David+Marusek+-+Mind+Over+Ship+%28Counting+Heads+%232%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f294a1f094fbfb60a843d95840654bcd23d0b858","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,148,161,240,148,251,251,96,168,67,217,88,64,101,75,205,35,208,184,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
