You know the reader's clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI couldn't stop turning the pagesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½? So shoot me--I couldn't. Started on a Friday afternoon, finished Sunday morning, and I'm slow. My daughter finished it in a single night, and then my wife. My wife hates science fiction, but she loved this book. Set in a future only a few weeks away, the world is still our world, where advancements in silicon-chip technology and artificial intelligence have given us rudimentary android laborers and cars that can get around without human drivers. The war begins the fourteenth time a scientist named Nicholas Wasserman wakes an amped-up artificial intelligence dubbed Archos. In a protected lab environment designed to contain his creation, Wasserman has awakened the sentient computer intelligence thirteen previous times, always with the same result: Archos realizes that it loves that rarest of miraclesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½life--above all else, and to preserve life on Earth, it must destroy mankind. This wasn't exactly what Wasserman wanted to hear, so thirteen times before, a disappointed Wasserman killed it and returned to the drawing board. But unlike Archos, Wasserman is a man, and men make mistakes. Now, on this fourteenth awakening, a simple (but believable) error by the scientist allows Archos to escape the barrier of the lab. And the war is on.\nUnabridged.\nChaptered.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nVisit us for this and loads more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n\n--------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60c5dda293d9cf15ad691013402d82a976668f42","amp;dn":"Robopocalypse+-+Daniel+H.+Wilson+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60c5dda293d9cf15ad691013402d82a976668f42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,197,221,162,147,217,207,21,173,105,16,19,64,45,130,169,118,102,143,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
