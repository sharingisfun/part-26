It is the last album to feature the group's original keyboardist Peter Bardens, who left the group before the tour for the album. He was replaced with two keyboardists for the tour: Dave Sinclair (Bassist Richard Sinclair's cousin) and Jan Schelhaas.\n\nThe album focuses on shorter, radio-friendly songs, as the group was trying to gain some airplay. Also, the group gives their sound another feel on some tracks. For example, the humorous &quot;Down on the Farm&quot; sounds like Caravan (The song's feel, besides Richard Sinclair is the lead singer), and &quot;Summer Lightning&quot; has a disco-feel with extended solos from Bardens and Latimer.\n\nHowever, the group retained its jazz influence and progressive sound on other tracks. Notable examples of this are &quot;The Sleeper&quot; and &quot;Echoes&quot;, which sound similar to music contained on early albums like Mirage and Moonmadness. Both songs are highlights of the album, and &quot;Echoes&quot; also became a favorite on the group's live repertoire, and is considered among fans as one of the best songs the group ever recorded.\n\nThis album shows how the band continued transforming their sound into a pop-like sound, while it also displays the group's progressive and jazz roots and other styles as well.\n\nReleased September 22, 1978 \nRecorded 1978 \nGenre Progressive rock \nLength 44:54 \nLabel Deram Records \nProducer Camel/Mick Glossop \n\n[edit] Side One\n&quot;Breathless&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ (Andrew Latimer, Peter Bardens, Andy Ward) - 4:19 \n&quot;Echoes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ (Latimer, Bardens, Ward) - 7:18 \n&quot;Wing and a Prayer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ (Latimer, Bardens) - 4:45 \n&quot;Down on the Farm&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ (Richard Sinclair) - 4:24 \n&quot;Starlight Ride&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ (Latimer, Bardens) - 3:25 \n[edit] Side Two\n&quot;Summer Lightning&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ (Latimer, Sinclair) - 6:09 \n&quot;You Make Me Smile&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ (Latimer, Bardens) - 4:17 \n&quot;The Sleeper&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ (Latimer, Bardens, Ward, Mel Collins) - 7:06 \n&quot;Rainbow's End&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ (Latimer, Bardens) - 3:00 \n[edit] Personnel\nAndrew Latimer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar, Yamaha CS80/50, Vocals (A 2, 5, B 2, 4) \nPeter Bardens ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Keyboards, Organ, Vocals (A 3) \nMel Collins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Flute, Saxophones \nRichard Sinclair ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bass, Vocals (A 1, 4, B 1) \nAndy Ward ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Drums, Percussion \nDave Sinclair ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Keyboards (uncredited) (B 2, 4) \n[edit] Other credits\nEngineered by Mick Glossop \nOriginal artwork by Michael Munday &amp; CREAM \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:873af4df50b7bb99b2631494e0e9f584fb741f60","amp;dn":"Camel...Breathless%281978%29cd+rip%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"873af4df50b7bb99b2631494e0e9f584fb741f60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,58,244,223,80,183,187,153,178,99,20,148,224,233,245,132,251,116,31,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
