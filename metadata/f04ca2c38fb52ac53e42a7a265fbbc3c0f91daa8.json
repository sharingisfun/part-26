One evening, after his\nusual eight-hour bartending shift, he finds a typewritten note\nunder the windshield wiper of his car.\n\n&quot;If you don't take this note to the police and get them involved, I\nwill kill a lovely blond schoolteacher. If you do take this note to\nthe police, I will instead kill an elderly woman active in charity\nwork. You have six hours to decide. The choice is yours.&quot;\n\nIt seems like a sick joke, and Billy's friend on the police force,\nLanny Olsen, thinks so too. His advice to Billy is to go home and\nforget about it. But less than twenty-four hours later, a young\nblond schoolteacher is found murdered, and it's Billy's fault: he\ndidn't convince the police to get involved. Now he's got another\nnote, another deadline, another ultimatum...and two new lives\nhanging in the balance.\n\nSuddenly Billy's average, seemingly innocuous life takes on the\ndimensions and speed of an accelerating nightmare. Because the\nnotes are coming faster, the deadlines growing tighter, and the\nkiller becoming bolder and crueler with every communicationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½until\nBilly is isolated with the terrifying knowledge that he alone has\nthe power of life and death over a psychopath's innocent victims.\nUntil the struggle between good and evil is intensely personal.\nUntil the most chilling words of all are: The choice is yours.\n\n----\n\nDean Koontz, the author of many #1 New York Times bestsellers,\nlives with his wife, Gerda, and the enduring spirit of their golden\nretriever, Trixie, in southern California.\n\n----\n\nMichael Hayden is a prolific actor who has received Tony\nnominations for his roles in each of the following: All My Sons,\nJudgment in Nuremberg, Far East, and as Prince Hal opposite Kevin\nKline in Lincoln Theater's Henry IV: Parts I and II.
