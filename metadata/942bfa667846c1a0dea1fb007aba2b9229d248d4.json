We didn't wake up one morning and the Internet was there. You know? How did we get there? That's what you want to know about history for.&quot;\n\nBBS The Documentary is an absolutely spectacular three disk documentary on the earliest days of the development of the BBS, nodes, Fidonet, CompuServe, and right on up to the Internet. You'll see many scenes involving all the great old first generation PCs such as Atari, Apple, Commodore and more. All things considered the total run time is about seven hours. I have reduced the 20 gigs of those three dual layer DVDs down to less than three gigs of avi files in the hope it will prompt some people to buy the real DVD set, which has extra audio commentary tracks and even subtitles. It is truly a gem.\n\nAll of these avis are individual within the torrent so you can grab a small one to check the quality before you commit to the whole download. The only part that's rarred is the dvd-rom extras from disk 3 since it had about 6,000 files inside, tons of photos and audio files and other goodies. If you're a fan of the early days, BBS The Documentary is a must.\n\nThis torrent includes all of the still frames, easter eggs, and dvd-rom extras.\n\nCover scan: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dvdmadhouse.com/x09236wtm/bbs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dvdmadhouse.com/x09236wtm/bbs.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMDB page: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460402&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460402&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBBS The Documentary Home Page: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbsdocumentary.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbsdocumentary.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWired Magazine's article: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/06/67776&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/06/67776&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon's page of excellent customer reviews: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/BBS-Documentary-Jason-Scott/dp/B0009NN6EA/sr=1-1/qid=1161651440/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-1509081-1519303?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/BBS-Documentary-Jason-Scott/dp/B0009NN6EA/sr=1-1/qid=1161651440/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-1509081-1519303?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:942bfa667846c1a0dea1fb007aba2b9229d248d4","amp;dn":"BBS+The+Documentary+-+Atari+Apple+Commodore+IBM+-+Early+Days","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"942bfa667846c1a0dea1fb007aba2b9229d248d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,43,250,102,120,70,193,160,222,161,251,0,122,186,43,146,41,210,72,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
