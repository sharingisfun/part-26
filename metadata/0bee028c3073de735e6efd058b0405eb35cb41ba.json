Many of the people who saw it drove from cities and states that had not booked it. Thanks in large part to its trailer being available on Apple's site and iTunes, untold thousands of people were made aware of the movie and its soundtrack.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I especially appreciated that filmmaker Aaron Hendren did something different with the whole 'survival horror' subgenre and didn't give us just another Texas Chainsaw Massacre retread. Flicker comes highly recommended!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fatally Yours\n\nFlicker is now available on DVD, and the soundtrack is available where you buy music.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Katy Houska is perfect as Pretty, who starts off as a normal girl but after her harrowing ordeal starts to fray at the edges until she triumphantly is reborn as an ass-kicking machine.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fatally Yours\n\nFlicker is the feature film about a weekend camping trip to a small mountain town. Pretty and Jack wake up in the middle of the night to discover that their friends are missing. A bloody tent, homicidal cops, creepy locals and brutal elements create the world that Pretty must escape.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Pretty goes through a transformation into an ass-kicker in one of the more daring performances I have seen by an actress in an indie flick.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ - The Video Graveyard\nFlicker was written and directed by Aaron Hendren. It stars Katy Houska, Babak Tafti, Kate Schroeder, Kevin R. Elder, Alex Knight, Lauren Poole, Jason Witter, Julibeth Hendren, Abigail H. Blueher, Hannah Kauffmann, Courtney Bell and Miranda Kay-Lena. Soundtrack and score by The Bad Memories and Jimmy Deveney, with additional score by CK Barlow.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bee028c3073de735e6efd058b0405eb35cb41ba","amp;dn":"Flicker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bee028c3073de735e6efd058b0405eb35cb41ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,238,2,140,48,115,222,115,94,110,253,5,139,4,5,235,53,203,65,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
