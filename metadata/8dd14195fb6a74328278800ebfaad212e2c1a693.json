It features the first part of &quot;The History of Iron Maiden&quot; series, a 90 minute documentary which describes their beginnings in London's East End in 1975 through to the Piece of Mind album and tour in 1983. The second part of the series was included on disc 2 of the Live After Death DVD release in 2008. The set also features a large collection of rare videos and concert footage, as well as interviews with former members such as Paul Di'Anno, Clive Burr, Dennis Stratton, Dave Sullivan, Terry Rance, Doug Sampson, Ron Matthews, Terry Wapram and Bob Sawyer.\n\nThe second disk contains footage from Ruskin Arms, shot in 1980, just after the release of the first album. Perfectionists will criticize the poor sound and picture quality of this video and audio, but, to be honest, what can you expect from a pub gig shot by a mate of the bands'? The video is a very thrilling watch, particularly for NWOBHM enthusiasts, but also for those who like to go to pub and club gigs. You really do get the feeling that you are *there* in the midst of the crowd. Apart from that, watching Paul bursting out in laughter onstage is priceless! This video contains the only officially released live version of &quot;Charlotte The Harlot&quot; and many other forgotten classics from that time\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3] [Ripped from DVD - audio only]\n\nLive At The Ruskin Arms (1980)\n\n    &quot;Sanctuary&quot;\n    &quot;Wrathchild&quot;\n    &quot;Prowler&quot;\n    &quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot;\n    &quot;Running Free&quot;\n    &quot;Transylvania&quot;\n    &quot;Another Life&quot;\n    &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;\n    &quot;Charlotte the Harlot&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dd14195fb6a74328278800ebfaad212e2c1a693","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Live+At+The+Ruskin+Arms+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dd14195fb6a74328278800ebfaad212e2c1a693","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,209,65,149,251,106,116,50,130,120,128,14,191,170,210,18,226,193,166,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
