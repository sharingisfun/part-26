The title doesn't mention it, but all the tunes are from 'The Nutcracker', and they are, further, the most well-known pieces from 'The Nutcracker', but the fact that you've heard these all a thousand times before only makes these renditions more endearing -- well, it made them more endearing to me, anyway. This might just mean I have no taste, but I am not interested in considering that possibility.\r\n\r\nMany of the pieces chosen here are also represented on Duke Ellington's 'Three Suites' album, but the CJQ's treatment is markedly different; generally speaking, the quartet will use a particular melody to create an appropriate texture, and then play more or less traditional solos. The Sugar-Plum Fairy's dance ends up sounding remarkably similar to John Lewis' 'Django'; the jaunty Dance of the Reeds is almost unrecognizable at the beginning, transformed into a beautifully meditative piece featuring some particularly poignant piano work from Kenny Barron; but this only lasts until about the halfway point, when the Reeds' secondary melody is introduced, eventually leading to something akin to Bobby Hutcherson's Latin-tinged work","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edb52a7413d4755ee637437c800d42e50e1e12ea","amp;dn":"The+Classical+Jazz+Quartet+-+Play+Tchaikovsky+%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edb52a7413d4755ee637437c800d42e50e1e12ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,181,42,116,19,212,117,94,230,55,67,124,128,13,66,229,14,30,18,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
