In the meantime, a bright but naive young Soviet engineer, Vladimir Barkov (Andrei Vertogradov), is ensnared by Western intelligence agencies.\n\nWith its rose-colored depiction of Soviet society and deep Cold War paranoia, The Secret AgentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Destiny will be enjoyed by cultural history aficionados as well as fans of realistic spy fiction.\n\nThe second installment in the Secret Agent series: The Secret AgentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blunder (1968), The Secret AgentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Destiny (1970), The Secret AgentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Return (1982), and The End of Operation Ã¢â‚¬Å“Secret AgentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1986). Russian president Vladimir Putin, a former KGB agent himself, has stated that his career as an intelligence officer was prompted in part by ZhzhonovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performance in these films.\n\nThis version is the result of efforts to improve both the video and subtitles from the low-quality Ruscico DVD. Video has been exactingly cleaned up as follows:\n\n- Cropped windowboxing (source DVD is overcropped on the sides, unfortunately)\n- Stabilized gate weave\n- Removed flickering\n- Removed blue tint\n- Corrected levels and restored crushed blacks\n- Recovered details and reduced aliasing\n- Cleaned noise and banding\n- (See the before / after reel and final screenshot at the link above)\n\nSubtitles have been edited line-by-line for readability and accuracy. There are two English subtitle tracks, identical save for format:\n\n- Default track: lower resolution IDX (VobSub) format; compatible with many standalone media players\n- Secondary track: high resolution SSA format; recommended if watching on a computer\n\nTechnical details:\n\n- B&amp;W, 25 fps, 692x376\n- (Resolution unaltered from DVD except for removal of black windowboxing)\n- (Displayed at 738x376 with 1.066 PAL pixel aspect ratio)\n- 48 kHz, 192 Kbps stereo AC3 (unaltered DVD original)\n- x264 in MKV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9188f436b29c324a6ac7cf2bd7644b981785cb5d","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Agent%27s+Destiny+%28%D0%A1%D1%83%D0%B4%D1%8C%D0%B1%D0%B0+%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0+%2F+Sudba+Rezidenta%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9188f436b29c324a6ac7cf2bd7644b981785cb5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,136,244,54,178,156,50,74,106,199,207,43,215,100,75,152,23,133,203,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
