Perfect cover for a Black Bank - a bank within a bank - clandestinely identifying dealers in arms and drugs, terrorist groups and cartels from across the globe... But you can't fight the bosses of the Mafia SA while sitting at your desk, and Baeckes is too old to globe-trot. So he's chosen his action man: Adrian Stolker and with him, a token of legality: Alicia Jones, 30 years old and a CIA agent. Two men, one woman, with just one mission: to track down, one by one, the godfathers of crime across the world.\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a27be4388d3e2ae71cf11f8b8e13bd78e8113bff","amp;dn":"Black+Bank+T01+%282007%29+%28DRAGONZ%29+cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a27be4388d3e2ae71cf11f8b8e13bd78e8113bff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,123,228,56,141,62,42,231,28,241,31,139,142,19,189,120,232,17,59,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
