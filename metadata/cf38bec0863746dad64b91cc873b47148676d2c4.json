In addition to playing the super slick Los Angeles and New York club scenes, she performs regularly at homes for the elderly in compliance with her inner octogenarian.\n\nDespite her biting sarcasm and unrepentant banter, Katie truly strives to be a sounding voice for the hopelessly warped, while simultaneously promoting the significance and paramount need for genuine creative passion. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.katiecostellomusic.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.katiecostellomusic.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf38bec0863746dad64b91cc873b47148676d2c4","amp;dn":"Katie.Costello-Kaleidoscope.Machine%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf38bec0863746dad64b91cc873b47148676d2c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,56,190,192,134,55,70,218,214,75,145,204,135,59,71,20,134,118,210,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
