Souther (guitar / vocals on &quot;Best Of My Love&quot;)\n\n\nRegarding the date - some things strongly suggests this was not a 1977 show because of a lack of songs like &quot;New Kid In Town&quot; which reached #1 in the charts in 1977. During the show, J.D. Souther mentions that it&amp;#039;s Glenn Frey&amp;#039;s birthday (November 6) - which means they would have performed a full show in late 1977 without playing their number one hit of the year - which just doesn&amp;#039;t make sense. Also, Randy Meisner left the Eagles in September 1977 - which is the month the &quot;Hotel California&quot; tour ended.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd23aa185dae2907e0e71241ded66a6de380d3e4","amp;dn":"Eagles+1976+Houston+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd23aa185dae2907e0e71241ded66a6de380d3e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,35,170,24,93,174,41,7,224,231,18,65,222,214,106,109,227,128,211,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
