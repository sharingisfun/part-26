Forstchen now brings us a story which can be all too terrifyingly real...a story in which one man struggles to save his family and his small North Carolina town after America loses a war, in one second, a war that will send America back to the Dark Ages...A war based upon a weapon, an Electro Magnetic Pulse (EMP). A weapon that may already be in the hands of our enemies.\r\n\r\nMonths before publication, One Second After has already been cited on the floor of Congress as a book all Americans should read, a book already being discussed in the corridors of the Pentagon as a truly realistic look at a weapon and its awesome power to destroy the entire United States, literally within one second. It is a weapon that the Wall Street Journal warns could shatter America. In the tradition of On the Beach, Fail Safe and Testament, this book, set in a typical American town, is a dire warning of what might be our future...and our end.\r\n\r\nWritten by: William R. Forstchen\r\nNarrated by: Joe Barrett\r\nLength: 13 hrs and 21 mins\r\nFormat: Unabridged\r\nRelease Date:03-17-09","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a273a9545dc958e586f4e8f3e13736897f6a2059","amp;dn":"William+R.+Forstchen+-+One+Second+After+%28After+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a273a9545dc958e586f4e8f3e13736897f6a2059","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,115,169,84,93,201,88,229,134,244,232,243,225,55,54,137,127,106,32,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
