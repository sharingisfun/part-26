The town and its guardians, the Night Horde MC, relax into this moment of hope, looking toward the future for the first time in decades.\n\nEveryone but Robert Ã¢â‚¬Å“ShowdownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ryan. Having suffered tremendous loss in that war, and taking on the burden of blame for it, Show has nothing left of himself. He is an empty husk of a man, drowning in grief and whiskey, seeking relief in numbness.\n\nShannon Bannerman has come to Signal Bend to manage the new Keller Acres Bed &amp; Breakfast. She has left a successful city life to start anew in this tiny town, trying to keep the door closed on the regrets of her past.\n\nShannon is drawn to Show despite his stony detachment, and he is drawn to her despite his need to stay numb. But the pain in their pasts is deep and damaging. Only real love, like neither of them has ever known, could heal it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3a80bccf2ab44cc9215ddf1ab558befd74f6373","amp;dn":"Into+the+Storm+%28Signal+Bend+%233%29+by+Susan+Fanetti+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3a80bccf2ab44cc9215ddf1ab558befd74f6373","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,168,11,204,242,171,68,204,146,21,221,241,171,85,139,239,215,79,99,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
