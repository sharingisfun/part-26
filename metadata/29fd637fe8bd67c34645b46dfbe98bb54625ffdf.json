The .sim3pack's decrapified, and rigfixed, of course.\n\nIt's a month set, not like shits on TPB (missing items, previous month items,etc), if you want to get ALL the updates released in current month, always take mine. \n\nSo there's a FiXER_v2 folder in the torrent (which fixes the new bugged items+allows moodlets), you have to use the .packages inside to get work some new items, which got fucked up, because of the decrapifier. If you do this right, everything is going to work. (see below)\n\n!!!! WARNING !!!! IF YOU'RE GETTING MY SET'S FROM MONTH TO MONTH, YOU MUST DELETE FROM YOUR PACKAGES THE &quot;Lunar_Lakes-Tree_of_Prosperity_(FiX)&quot; (FROM FEBRUARY UPD) BECAUSE THE NEW FIX ALREADY INCLUDES THAT FIX TOO, AND IF YOU KEEP IT, THEY GOING TO CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER. !!!!\n\niNSTRUCTiONS:\n--------------\n*This fix assumes that ALL affected items are installed the same way*\n|\n|___if you got the previous fix from the May set, you just replace the old files with the new ones!\n\n1)  Everyone will need this file-----KT_StoreFix_Awesome.package\n2)  !!!!If you don't use Awesomemod you will also need this file!!!!-----KT_StoreFix_UnAwesome.package\n3)  If your premium store content is decrapified (like all of my sets) you need this too-----ccmerged_decrapped.package\n\n\n*!!!!If you use packages make sure to put these in your overrides folder, if you use the .sim3pack's put these in your packages folder!!!!*\n\nFiXES THE FOLLOWiNG:\n---------------------\n+No ladle for decrapped Lord Vladimir's Magic Cauldron\n+No needle for decrapped Malleable Mimic Voodoo Doll\n+No fruit for decrapped Tree of Prosperity\n+No food for decrapped Sizzle Baby Pro Deep Fryer and Frost-Bite Pro Ice Cream Machine\n+No handset for the decrapped Vintage Rotary Phone\n+Routing issue with Banquett Fan\n+Wall cut-outs for the Modernism Window, Not-So-Private Study Door, Nega-Door, Gothique Window and the Muntin Window\n+Fixed middle slots on the Vineyard Vittles Dining Table \n+The Ultimate Career Bundle unlocked\n+Working Pet Register\n+Buff conflicts with the following items: Sharper Sim's Super Sleeper, MultiTab 6000, The Hypnotizer, Malleable Mimic Voodoo Doll, Lord Vladimir's Magic Cauldron, Frost-Bite Pro Ice Cream Machine, Sizzle Baby Pro Deep Fryer, Leon's Fountain of Youth\n+Reset bug with Lady Ravendancer Goth's Book o' Spells\n=NEW in v2!=\n+No coins for decrapped Wishing Well \n+Gambling Skill Icon fixed for decrapped Casino\n+Buff conflicts with: Wishing Well\n\nJUNE SET:\n---------\n-barHotel   \n-barstoolHotel\n-chairDiningHotel\n-tableDiningHotelRound\n-arcadeMachineUnicorn\n-arcadeMachineZombie\n-SPBcactusSet\n-paintingPosterIcecreamKP\n-LuckySimoleonSET\n\n\nWRITE ONLY USERS PLEASE STOP IRRATING.
