And for years, people have been crafting prayer shawls - knitted wraps to comfort those in times of need and to help others celebrate special occasions. Written by the two women at the heart of this groundswell of charity knitting, The Prayer Shawl Companion presents 38 wondrous wraps for all occasions, from baptism to remembrance. The book includes easy, intermediate, and challenging patterns for such inspiring creations as The Calming Shawl, and the Friendship Patchwork Shawl, and many more. Since knitting itself can be a gloriously spiritual activity, Bristow and Cole-Galo also offer advice on creating a peaceful creative environment and include heartwarming stories to and from shawl recipients. Professional knitwear designers like Kaffe Fassett and Nicky Epstein have donated more than 10 patterns.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:462f6560dbdfdf898aaacf2ff6960426c44c1366","amp;dn":"The+Prayer+Shawl+Companion%3A+38+Knitted+Designs+to+Embrace+Inspir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"462f6560dbdfdf898aaacf2ff6960426c44c1366","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,47,101,96,219,223,223,137,138,170,207,47,246,150,4,38,196,76,19,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
