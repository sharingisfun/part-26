Armed with an array of powerful telescopes, scientists are finding up to 3000 new asteroids every night. And some are heading our way. But astronomers have discovered that it's not the giant rocks that are the greatest danger - it's the small asteroids that pose a more immediate threat to Earth. Researchers have explained the photon propulsion that propels these rocks across space, and have discovered that some asteroids are carrying a mysterious cargo of frost and ice across the solar system that could have helped start life on earth.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.72GB\nSubtitles: merged (SRT available at MVGroup)\nSource: DVB-S\n\nThe Xvid is also available at MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc0eb49ce7664b5f6aa94d9df315237f5c8d35ea","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+2010+Asteroids+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc0eb49ce7664b5f6aa94d9df315237f5c8d35ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,14,180,156,231,102,75,95,106,169,77,157,243,21,35,127,92,141,53,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
