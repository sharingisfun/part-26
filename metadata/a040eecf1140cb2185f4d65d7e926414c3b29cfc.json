Together with Blackie Lawless and Randy Piper, he was one the founding members of the heavy metal band W.A.S.P.\n\n\nCareer\n\nChris Holmes is a heavy metal guitarist and songwriter who started his musical career in the Pasadena, California area in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He is best known as the lead guitarist of heavy-metal band W.A.S.P.. Prior to meeting Blackie Lawless and Randy Piper, and joining W.A.S.P., Holmes played guitar with L.A. bands Buster Savage, LAX, and Slave. Holmes was a member of W.A.S.P. first from 1983 to 1990, and again from 1996 to 2001.\n\nW.A.S.P.\n\nHolmes joined W.A.S.P. in 1983, and remained with the group until 1990. In 1996 Holmes rejoined W.A.S.P., and remained lead guitarist until 2001. Holmes has not played with W.A.S.P. since.\n\n&quot;The Metal Years&quot; Interview\n\nWhile a member of W.A.S.P., Holmes participated in the filming of the documentary film, The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years. The film included interviews with many well known heavy metal personalities of the era discussing their lifestyle and the metal scene in late 1980s Los Angeles.\nHolmes' contribution to the 1988 documentary is perhaps the most memorable, as he was interviewed while floating in a swimming pool, fully clothed and visibly quite intoxicated while his mother sat poolside. The interview stood out in stark contrast to the more light-hearted and humorous interviews conducted by director Penelope Spheeris, which mostly portrayed rockers as good-natured, though often dimwitted or deluded, party animals. During the interview, Holmes smiled drunkenly at the camera, deeming himself &quot;a full-blown alcoholic&quot; and &quot;a piece of crap&quot; despite his band's success, and punctuated his remarks by guzzling from three bottles of vodka. At the end of the interview, Holmes upends a full bottle of Smirnoff over his head as he rolls out of his inflatable chair and into the water.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHolmes has been married twice. First to Kaylen Rodgers in the late 1980s, then briefly to Lita Ford in the early 1990s.\n\nRandy PiperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Animal\n\nHolmes was contacted by friend and former bandmate Randy Piper to join Piper's new project, Animal. Holmes quickly relocated to Ohio to prepare for Animal's upcoming &quot;900 lb Steam&quot; tour. The tour was considered successful, and after its conclusion, Animal (with Holmes) recorded tracks for a new album.\n\nAfter Animal\n\nAfter Holmes returned to Los Angeles in late 2003, he began working with several Southern California-based metal groups, producing and contributing guitar tracks. In 2007, Holmes was involved with the filming of a Randy Rhoads documentary directed by Peter M. Margolis, which has yet to be released. Holmes appears briefly in a 2009 episode of VH1's Rock Docs, &quot;Do It For The Band: The Women of Sunset Strip.&quot; In the Summer of 2009 Holmes released Secret Society's &quot;Death by Misadventure.&quot;\n\nWhere Angels Suffer\n\nIn 2010, he joined Where Angels Suffer with Randy Piper (W.A.S.P.) on guitar, Steve Unger (Metal Church) on bass, Rich Lewis (Animal), on vocals, and Stet Howland on drums (Blackfoot, Lita Ford, Killing Machine, Belladonna, Impellitteri, Sister and W.A.S.P.).\n\n320 k\nSize:\t130.44 MB 16 files\n \t\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01.
