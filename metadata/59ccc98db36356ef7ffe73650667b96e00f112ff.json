Klemperer recorded the work several times, most famously with soprano Elizabeth Schwarzkopf, mezzo-soprano Hilde Russl-Madjan and the Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus in 1962. In this live, late-1960s recording (which I doubt you guess was recorded live), the tempos are a little quicker and the piece is perhaps a bit more dramatic. In any case, it's a stunning performance and was beautifully recorded. The disc is prized among collectors and is relatively rare. It was released as part of EMI's &quot;Klemperer&quot; Legacy series and went out of print after a relatively short time.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59ccc98db36356ef7ffe73650667b96e00f112ff","amp;dn":"Gustav+Mahler+-+Symphony+No.+2+in+C+Minor+%28%26quot%3BResurrection%26qu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59ccc98db36356ef7ffe73650667b96e00f112ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,204,201,141,179,99,86,239,127,254,115,101,6,103,185,110,0,241,18,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
