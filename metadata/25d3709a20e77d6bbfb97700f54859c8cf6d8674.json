But they persevered and earned a contract with Reprise Records, releasing their self-titled debut album in June 2002. Having only played a handful of shows around Orem prior to their record's release, the band -- vocalist Bert McCracken, guitarist Quinn Allman, bassist Jeph Howard, and drummer Branden Steineckert -- began relentless nationwide touring that quickly saw their fan base multiply. Club dates soon turned into successful stints on larger-scale festival/package tours including the Warped Tour, Ozzfest, and Projekt Revolution alongside Linkin Park and Snoop Dogg. In the summer of 2003, the Used issued the introspective CD/DVD Maybe Memories, which contained unreleased songs, live material, behind-the-scenes footage, and more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25d3709a20e77d6bbfb97700f54859c8cf6d8674","amp;dn":"The+Used+-+The+Ocean+of+the+Sky+EP+%282013%29+%5BMP3+320%5D+politux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25d3709a20e77d6bbfb97700f54859c8cf6d8674","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,211,112,154,32,231,125,107,191,185,119,0,245,72,89,200,207,109,134,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
