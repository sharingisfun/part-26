To quell the East vs. West debate, Baker joined New York all-stars like Johnny Griffin, Al Haig, and the Miles Davis rhythm team of Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones for a rousing session that is one for the history books. Listening to these seven standards, there&amp;#039;s little doubt that this cross-pollination was a successful experiment.\n\nBaker, sticking to trumpet, sounds just as smooth and laid back as usual. From brisk numbers such as &quot;Hotel 49&quot; to blue ballads such as &quot;Polka Dots and Moonbeams,&quot; the trumpeter always projects his cool image, only now with a subtle urging from his East Coast sidemen. Griffin is complimentary to the leader, and shines on tasty solo spots such as Benny Golson&amp;#039;s swinging opener &quot;Fair Weather.&quot; Chambers and Jones get a chance to record a very different take of Davis&amp;#039; classic &quot;Solar,&quot; here featuring Baker&amp;#039;s velvety wanderings at a mid-tempo lope. Other choice cuts in this experiment include the bouncing &quot;When Lights Are Low&quot; and Benny Goodman&amp;#039;s lazily swinging &quot;Soft Winds.&quot;\n\nPersonnel: \nChet Baker (trumpet)\nJohnny Griffin (tenor saxophone)\nAl Haig (piano)\nPaul Chambers (bass)\nPhilly Joe Jones (drums)\n\nRecorded at Reeves Sound Studios, New York, New York in September 1958. \n\nTrack Listing:\n1.Fair Weather\n2.Polka Dots And Moonbeams\n3.Hotel 49\n4.Solar\n5.Blue Thoughts\n6.When Lights Are Low\n7.Soft Winds - (bonus track)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fec4fe7ce711f7e94dbcbc0562ca2666406e1591","amp;dn":"Chet+Baker+-+In+New+York+%281958%29+%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fec4fe7ce711f7e94dbcbc0562ca2666406e1591","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,196,254,124,231,17,247,233,77,188,188,5,98,202,38,102,64,110,21,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
