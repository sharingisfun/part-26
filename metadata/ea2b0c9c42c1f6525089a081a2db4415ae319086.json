As a result, \nCyclops apologises to Emma whilst Hisako strives to learn from her mistakes. \nAs the X-Men prepare to leave for Tohoku with the vaccines, Emma questions Xavier about a woman named Yui Sasaki which she saw when their minds were linked. \n\nSpoken Language:- Japanese\n\nSubtitled Language English\nSubtitles by [Commie] \n=============================\n\nScreenshots\n-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n\n[URL=http://img94.imageshack.us/i/xmenanime105powerunitye.jpg/][IMG]http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/9015/xmenanime105powerunitye.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n================================\n\nFile Info\n-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 177M\nPlayTime           : 00:23:44.724\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : DX50\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 42699\nVideoBitRate       : 902864\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\nFormat:- Divx AVI\n\n=============================\n\nHash\n-=-=-=-\n\nEA2B0C9C42C1F6525089A081A2DB4415AE319086\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea2b0c9c42c1f6525089a081a2db4415ae319086","amp;dn":"X-Men%5Banime%5D-105-Power%7EUnity-Eng-Subs-Divx-%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea2b0c9c42c1f6525089a081a2db4415ae319086","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,43,12,156,66,193,246,82,80,137,160,129,162,219,68,21,174,49,144,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
