Eun-ho is tense, irritable and difficult to work with, but Jung-eun finds her assignment fascinating because Eun-ho claims he began acting not because he wanted to become a star but because he thought being in the limelight would help him find his first love, Ji Eun-dong. Eun-ho and Eun-dong's complicated romantic history has spanned two decades, and he's convinced that he can never love anyone else. As Jung-eun helps him remember Eun-dong and why he lost her, Eun-ho (whose birth name is Park Hyun-soo) looks back on his memories of her, from when they met in 1995 when he was seventeen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70652d42cdbbd65a84a0ea220df9f8b03bfc3693","amp;dn":"My+Love+Eun+Dong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70652d42cdbbd65a84a0ea220df9f8b03bfc3693","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,101,45,66,205,187,214,90,132,160,234,34,13,249,248,176,59,252,54,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
