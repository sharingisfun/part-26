Yet Par Ohmsford still has \n\nsome power of the Wishsong. And when a message from \n\nthe ancient Druid, Allanon, reaches them, Par is \n\nordered to recover the long-lost Sword of Shinnara, \n\nand the glory that once was the Four Lands....\n\n=================================================\n\nThe Druid of Shannara:\n\n\nThe battle against the evil Shadowen continues as \n\nWalker Boh embarks on a perilous journey to rcover \n\nthe black Elfstone and restore the lost Druid keep \n\nof Paranor.\n\n=================================================\n\nThe Elf Queen of Shannara:\n\n\n&quot;Find the Elves and return them to the world of Men!&quot; \n\nthe shade of the Druid Allanon had ordered Wren.\n\nIt was clearly an impossible task. The Elves had been \n\ngone from the Westland for more than a hundred years. \n\nThere was not even a trace of their former city of \n\nArborlon left to mark their passing. No one in the \n\nEsterland knew of them -- except, finally, the \n\nAddershag.\n\nThe blind old woman had given instructions to find a \n\nplace on the coast of the Blue Divide, build a fire, \n\nand keep it burning for three days. &quot;One will come for \n\nyou.&quot;\n\nTiger Ty, the Wing Rider, had come on his giant Roc to \n\ncarry Wren and her friend Garth to the only clear \n\nlanding site on the island of Morrowindl, where, he \n\nsaid, the Elves might still exist, somewhere in the \n\ndemon-haunted jungle.\n\nNow she stood within that jungle, remembering the \n\nwarning of the Addershag: &quot;Beward, Elf-girl. I see \n\ndanger ahead for you . . . and evil beyond imagining.&quot; \n\nIt had proved all too true.\n\nWren stood with her single weapon of magic, listening \n\nas demons evil beyond all imagining gathered for attack. \n\nHow long could she resist?\n\nAnd if, by some miracle, she reached the Elves and could \n\nconvince them to return, how could they possibly retrace \n\nher perilous path to reach the one safe place on the coast?\n\n=================================================\n\nThe Talismans of Shannara:\n\n\nAlthough some of the goals to keep Shannara safe had been \n\nmet, the work of Walker Boh, Wren, and Par was not yet done. \n\nFor The Shadowmen still swarmed over the Four Lands, \n\npoisoning all with their dark magic. Each Shannaran had a \n\nspecial death waiting for him- at the hands of The \n\nShadowmen-unless Par could find a way to free them all with \n\nthe Sword of Shannara.\n\n=================================================\n\nEffloresce~TPB.\n\n=================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebf3e4e406bdc055c0a8ce113cabf36df54f5af6","amp;dn":"The+Heritage+of+Shannara+-+Terry+Brooks+%28epub+pdf+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebf3e4e406bdc055c0a8ce113cabf36df54f5af6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,243,228,228,6,189,192,85,192,168,206,17,60,171,243,109,245,79,90,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
