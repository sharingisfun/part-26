In fact, this disc is a must-have for McLachlan fans whose first encounter with her work was with her extremely popular later releases, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and Surfacing. The opening track, &quot;Drawn to the Rhythm,&quot; is a habit-forming gem of a song that soars on her smooth and heady soprano and Ronald Jones&amp;#039;s addictive drums (though the drone of the billatron in the chorus seems incongruous). The rumbling, electric &quot;Into the Fire&quot; grooves with a funky bass line; the lovelorn &quot;Path of Thorns&quot; and &quot;I Will Not Forget You&quot; are straight-ahead and bluesy. Always wise beyond her years, McLachlan displays a new awakening with introspective songs such as the Sinead O&amp;#039;Connor-esque &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;Shelter.&quot; The hymnlike &quot;Mercy&quot; is the least interesting song--spare in comparison to the others--but it is a wondrous showcase of her multifaceted voice. Without a doubt, Solace is a testament to McLachlan&amp;#039;s ever-swelling talent. --Rebecca Robinson ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db76124a4d48971f4fcc0835c7f867b09bbc889d","amp;dn":"Sarah+McLachlan+-+Solace+%5B1991%5D+MP3+vbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db76124a4d48971f4fcc0835c7f867b09bbc889d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,118,18,74,77,72,151,31,79,204,8,53,199,248,103,176,155,188,136,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
