First, install The Sims 8 in 1, then, install deluxe, then when you go to play, it will ask for The Sims Makin' Magic. Install all of that and you can play the Sims.\n\n\nI didn't explain clearly, apparently. First, install the sims 8 in 1. Then after that is done, (dont play) install the Sims Deluxe. Then, click play. It will ask you to put in The Sims Makin' Magic. So, thats when you mount that. After you put the disk in, hit ok and the game should install. After that is done, mount The Sims Deluxe Edition. You can now play the game. Windows 2000 seems to be able to play the game without the mounting but if you have windows Xp or 98, you stuck with mounting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f431b546328d4a1eeec0837bbca6d7504aacac68","amp;dn":"The+Sims+8+in+1%2C+deluxe%2C+Makin%5C%27+Magic.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f431b546328d4a1eeec0837bbca6d7504aacac68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,49,181,70,50,141,74,30,238,192,131,123,188,166,215,80,74,172,172,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
