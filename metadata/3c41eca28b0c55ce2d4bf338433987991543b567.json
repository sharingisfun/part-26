Cross would go on to bust thirty-nine dirty officers, earning himself &quot;a lot of hatred&quot; and the nickname &quot;the Grackle,&quot; after the bird that makes its home in others' nests. Eventually, his luck ran out, and an investigation of &quot;a group of rogue cops moonlighting as hitmen&quot; ended up with Cross himself under indictment. At his lowest point, Cross was recruited by the mysterious Colonel, and now performs the odd job of investigation or security.\n\n\nPlease Seed and Enjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c41eca28b0c55ce2d4bf338433987991543b567","amp;dn":"The+Grackle+%281997%29+Mike+Baron+%26amp%3B+Paul+Gulacy+Acclaim+Comics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c41eca28b0c55ce2d4bf338433987991543b567","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,65,236,162,139,12,85,206,45,75,243,56,67,57,135,153,21,67,181,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
