One of those songs is titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“State Of Shock,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s available to stream below.\n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure how old this demo is, but it sounds very old school. Even if you were not a fan of their recent trilogy, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a chance you will be into the demos. It would be nice to hear what another song or two sounds like before RSD, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure any hardcore fan of Green Day will have no problem dropping some cash on the record either way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52eb0c2063701182612ddb8e1f45f6fec1b1eb8c","amp;dn":"Green+Day+-+State+Of+Shock%5BNew+Song%5D%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52eb0c2063701182612ddb8e1f45f6fec1b1eb8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,235,12,32,99,112,17,130,97,45,219,142,31,69,246,254,193,177,235,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
