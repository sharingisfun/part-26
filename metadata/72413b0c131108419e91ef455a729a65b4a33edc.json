It is merely the beginning of a series of brutal and bizarre killings so apparently random, that only a warped genius could be responsible. Even when Lestrade pieces together the extraordinary pattern behind the crimes from the anonymous poems sent after each murder, he is no closer to knowing the identity of the sinister, self-styled &quot;Agrippa&quot;. It becomes a very personal battle and Lestrade's desperate race to avert the next death takes him from London to the Pennines and back. \n\nAbout The Author and Reader\nMeirion James Trow was born in Ferndale, South Wales. In his childhood he suffered from ill-health, so his parents decided to move to Macclesfield Forest, high in the Pennines. When he was seven they moved again, this time to Bubbenhall in Warwickshire. He went to Warwick School from 1961 to 1968. In 1968 he went to King's College, London, to read history. After graduation he spent a year at Jesus College, Cambridge. In 1973 he married and in 1976 the couple moved to the Isle of Wight. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72413b0c131108419e91ef455a729a65b4a33edc","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Inspector+Lestrade+-+M+J+Trow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72413b0c131108419e91ef455a729a65b4a33edc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,65,59,12,19,17,8,65,158,145,239,69,90,114,154,101,180,163,62,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
