It has never been released on CD so I have had to prepare this offering from the best source I had.  Hope you enjoy what I consider to be a great album.\n\nGrace - Grace (MCA/Clay) 1979 @ 192kbps\n\nFire of London\nBilly Boy\nCyril Dingle\nOld Stories\nLaughing Policeman\nI Am Lunar\nRikki The Rebel\nBuccaneer\nGeorge Commuter\n\n\n\nThe Early Years \nIn the late 1970's, a group of fellow art students decided to form a rock band. Initially, their influences showed in their music - &quot;Genesis&quot;, &quot;Jethro Tull&quot; and &quot;The Who&quot; were all major players in the shaping of the music played by Grace.\n\nHowever, even at this early stage, the band displayed several unique features as they played at the colleges and clubs of North Staffordshire. Firstly, the singer had a unique voice - powerful yet delicate, melodic yet aggressive. Secondly, the band featured TWO front men, both vying for centre stage. As well as the singer, a slightly manic flute and sax player shared honours for the lead position, resulting in a dramatic stage act. Thirdly, the songs played showed all the eclectic influences mentioned above, but they were also interwoven with the best elements of English folk rock. Grace rapidly developed a reputation for strong songs and a dynamic stage presence, and as a result the audience grew, and record companies became interested. \n\nThe first single, &quot;Old Stories&quot; was released in 1977, coupled with &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;, on an independent record label. It received very favourable reviews, and became the highlight of the set, which was played to an ever-growing audience. In 1979, the band was signed to MCA records, and a single was released in the same year called &quot;The Fire of London&quot;. The B side was &quot;Beatnik&quot;, reviews (and sales) went well. An album followed, simply called &quot;Grace&quot;. Reputation of the band as major exponents of what was now dubbed Progressive rock' was growing rapidly, both as a recording band and as a superb live act. The live act used lights, projections, costumes, mime, and of course the two front men. A second single (released in 1980), followed by a second album, called &quot;Grace Live&quot;. The live album featured what had become the anthem of the band - &quot;Molly Leigh (The witch of Burslem town), which featured mass crowd participation and hysteria. All was set for the breakthrough into mass acceptance\n\n. . . .... And then - nothing. \n \n \nMaybe it was the advent of punk maybe it was the bickering amongst the band members, maybe the band was frightened of success. Whatever the reasons, Grace split up in 1981, much to the shock of their hundreds of staunch followers. Individuals carried out a few splinter projects, but the only serious new contender was the formation of the synthesiser band White Door. The line up featured the vocalist (Mac) and Flautist (Harry) from the defunct Grace, together with brother John on keyboards. As White Door, they released an album (Windows) and several singles (including &quot;Windows&quot;, &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, and &quot;Flame in my Heart&quot;). Although the music represented an almost complete change of direction, the quality of song writing still showed through, and the established music press almost admitted to liking them.  \n\n\nThe Later Years \nThe scene now shifts to 1988, to a smoky old pub situated in the middle of North Staffordshire. Imagine - the singer sits with a pint and a friend. The old bass player walks in, the worse for a beer or three. Laughingly it is suggested that that it would be a great idea to reform the band for a one off Christmas reunion.\n\nThe reunion happened - in fact they played three times over that Christmas, and the massive audience that turned up proved that no-one had forgotten what had made Grace amazing - the songs, the performance, and the musicianship.\n\nAs the saying goes, one reunion leads to another, and another, and so on. Since that time, Grace have been writing a great deal of new music, which has been going down even better than the old songs. If you listen very carefully, you can still hear traces of old Genesis, or of Jethro Tull or indeed anyone you care to mention, But the style defies categorisation - it is melodic, delicate, powerful, emotive and it dares you to try and ignore it. Very simply the music sounds like Grace!\n\nAlthough Grace have undergone several personnel changes through its lifespan, the vocalist, the flautist / sax player, and the guitarist have always been with the band whilst the bass player was with the original line up.\n\nSince reforming, Grace have produced 3 albums on CD, together with a number of singles / EP's, and have performed regularly throughout Staffordshire and beyond, including head lining at the Rotherham Rock festival and trips to Europe and to the Hague in Holland. \n \n \n\nNow \nJust when you thought it safe to return to listening to tribute bands and cover bands, local band GRACE announce their return to the local live music scene. They last appeared live in February 1998 at the fund raising concert to attempt to save The Wheatsheaf at The Kings Hall re-forming specially for the night. They actually announced their split on the night of 22nd December 1997, when they played The Wheatsheaf to a capacity crowd and their double CD ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ A Gathering at The Wheat ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ was recorded (released April 1998 on the Cyclops label). Since then, all has been silent ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ until now!\n\nTwo members left which caused the original split, but these have been replaced with two excellent young musicians ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ David Markham on keyboards and Adam Rushton on guitar. Both aged twenty one, they have brought new music influences with them, adding to the Celtic/Classic/Rock sound of GRACE, amply demonstrated on their previous three CDÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s. Apart from this, introducing young new blood has almost halved the average age of the band ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ good news indeed!\n\nOld fans will think they know just what to expect (the flautist/saxophonist equipped with dustbin lids and rubber chickens, the vocalist with the mesmerist stage presence) - BUT ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ hang on. There are a lot of new songs, folkier, rockier, more driving. The style has changed, the old songs are now different, so be prepared for some special live guest appearances from the 'Burglar' and the 'Trainspotter' and lots more surprises. \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df14d3dea5d8b2991745385a6160862e4bdf63f1","amp;dn":"Grace+-+Grace+%5B1979%5D+Progressive+Rock+like+early+Genesis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df14d3dea5d8b2991745385a6160862e4bdf63f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,20,211,222,165,216,178,153,23,69,56,90,97,96,134,46,75,223,99,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
