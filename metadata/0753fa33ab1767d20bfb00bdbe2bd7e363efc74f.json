Lola thinks that Mark is a wealthy and successful author, while Mark thinks that Lola is a professional dancer at the top of her field. Actually, both have been stretching the truth to the breaking point; Mark is a writer, but he's still struggling to get his career off the ground, while Lola has just arrived in the U.S. with dreams of a career in show business and is still looking for a job. Can their budding romance survive learning the truth about each other? Looking for Lola was also released under the title Macarena. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0753fa33ab1767d20bfb00bdbe2bd7e363efc74f","amp;dn":"Looking+for+Lola%2FMacarena+%281998%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0753fa33ab1767d20bfb00bdbe2bd7e363efc74f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,83,250,51,171,23,103,210,11,251,0,189,190,43,215,227,99,239,199,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
