She is a Tracer, sent into our Universe by her makers to locate the six segments of the Key to Time. This being without a name wants the Doctor to be her assistant, but she doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t tell him the whole truth. Not at first.\n\nTheir first port of call is Mars, where a society that one day will become Ice Warriors lives in peace and civility. But the DoctorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s arrival will change all that.
