The body was never identified, but the fishing boat's crew did find interest in a document found on the corpse that spoke of a plan to collect insurance money for the sinking of the RMS Olympic. The letter has been passed down through the generations and the weathered and faded remnant now hangs in the helm of the Plymouth IV, where it is generally ignored. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee397/Phenom-Photobucket/Phenom/MurderTitanic1.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee397/Phenom-Photobucket/Phenom/MurderTitanic1.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d966ad47ee196a8e2ffa5c6125c24a9dd97c16d","amp;dn":"Murder+on+the+Titanic+-+Full+PreCracked+-+Foxy+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d966ad47ee196a8e2ffa5c6125c24a9dd97c16d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,150,106,212,126,225,150,168,226,255,165,198,18,92,36,169,221,151,193,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
