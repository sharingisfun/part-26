Supersymmetry\n\nRunning Time 61:05\nPlanetary Alignment\n\nReleased February 15, 2008\n\nThe instrumental album by George Bellas is arguably the most progressive album yet from the world renowned guitarist and composer. Uniquely crafted, be ready to expect the unexpected.\n\nMaestro George Bellas departs from the neoclassical excursions he is best known for on his latest release PLANETARY ALIGNMENT, a mind-boggling exercise in advanced musical concepts that simultaneously frustrates and inspires. Bellas is scary good, with a comprehensive knowledge of music theory making him a veritable human compendium of obscure chords, scales and rhythmic ideas, and on PLANETARY ALIGNMENT he introduces the listener to a startling array of them. Check out the drama of &quot;New Worlds Discovered,&quot; the creatively explosive &quot;Parallel Universe,&quot; the space trip-out &quot;Gravitons,&quot; or the intense &quot;Supersymmetry&quot; for samples of George's prowess. -- Review by Neal Woodall\n\nWell as always you listen and decide is this worthy....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a6ccef7464bb0217753fd186fdfab6c423f5acb","amp;dn":"George+Bellas+-+Planetary+Alignment++320k+mp3+++ak2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a6ccef7464bb0217753fd186fdfab6c423f5acb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,108,206,247,70,75,176,33,119,83,253,24,111,223,171,108,66,63,90,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
