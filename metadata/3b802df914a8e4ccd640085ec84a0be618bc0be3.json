It is rar\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'d. As for quality, they are all iTunes ready, and I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t care enough for specifics because of that. I should just assume that they are all 128 and that should be good enough for those of you downloading this for free.\n\n--- If for whatever reason this doesn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t work, LEAVE A COMMENT and I will do my best to fix it. This is my first larger scale torrent and I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m just hoping it works correctly.
