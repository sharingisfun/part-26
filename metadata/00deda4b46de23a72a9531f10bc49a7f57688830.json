The subjects of the series and the crimes themselves are often morally ambiguous. The characters themselves are complex, not least Stone himself who has a troubled relationship with his wife, is besiotted by his baby daughter and has increasingly strong feelings toward his colleague DS Sue Kelly.\n\nAn interesting and thought provoking creation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00deda4b46de23a72a9531f10bc49a7f57688830","amp;dn":"Stone+Series+1+to+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00deda4b46de23a72a9531f10bc49a7f57688830","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,222,218,75,70,222,35,167,42,149,49,241,11,196,154,127,87,104,136,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
