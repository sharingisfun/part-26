Their single &quot;Butterfly Girl&quot; was widely regarded as one of the most unusual singles ever released. One pre-eminent journalist wrote, &quot;&amp;#039;Butterfly Girl&amp;#039; is one of the most enchanting and unnerving songs I&amp;#039;ve heard in years,&quot; and another wrote, &quot;My heart broke the first time I heard it, and again every time thereafter.&quot; Their debut album with its mix of unearthly songs in spookily pretty sound-around and sudden tidal attacks of guitar, single-handedly debunked the shoegazer &quot;phenomena&quot; on which tail-end it arrived and highlighted its underwhelming mix of feyness and ambient drone.
