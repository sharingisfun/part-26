The characteristic sound is best described as a mix of folky 'humpah' followed by fast energetic guitar riffs with blasting drums. The fierce grunt and scream vocals are combined with clean vocals creating a firm folk sound. In numerous occasions the band joined the stage with bands like Turisas, Finntroll, Korpiklaani, Thyrfing, Manegarm, Heidevolk and many others.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.myrkvar.nl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.myrkvar.nl&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bbef67f45f9073a68b24c1c530dbb227601817b","amp;dn":"Myrkvar+Discography+%28March+2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bbef67f45f9073a68b24c1c530dbb227601817b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,190,246,127,69,249,7,58,104,178,76,28,83,13,187,34,118,1,129,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
