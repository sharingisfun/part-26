It&amp;#039;s no surprise, therefore, that her first release in six years is more than worth the wait. Her eye for detail, laconic vocal cool, and thematic focus on New York City continue to distinguish her artistry, but the sonic sheen applied by British producer/multi-instrumentalist Jimmy Hogarth sparks a musical renewal. Crisp guitar riffing recalls the streetwise work of fellow New York chronicler Lou Reed, while chamber strings, electronic atmospherics, and multitracked background vocals lift the results well beyond the folk realm. Vega writes from a perspective of memory and maturity, recalling the New York of old on &quot;Zephyr &amp; I&quot; and &quot;Ludlow Street,&quot; showing the musical sophistication of bittersweet seduction on &quot;New York Is a Woman,&quot; applying a musical Brazilian wax to &quot;Pornographer&amp;#039;s Dream,&quot; and contemplating her life as a wife on &quot;Bound&quot; and as a mother on the lullaby &quot;As You Are Now.&quot; The results are richly satisfying throughout. --Don McLeese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78267e919d532c43e6ba912d264958287d12033e","amp;dn":"%5B2007%5D+Suzanne+Vega+-+Beauty+%26+Crime","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78267e919d532c43e6ba912d264958287d12033e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,38,126,145,157,83,44,67,230,186,145,45,38,73,88,40,125,18,3,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
