Pure action samurai &quot;western&quot;, 21 April 2006 - rating: 8/10\nAuthor: Chung Mo from NYC\n\nStark, stylistic and no fooling around. Solid samurai action as a wandering ronin,\n&quot;The Vicious Wolf&quot;, wanders into a volatile situation at a remote relay post. Of\ncourse there's a couple of beautiful woman and nasty political intrigue involved.\nInteresting characters abound many are master killers with fearsome reputations.\nThe Vicious Wolf is a quirky character with a bizarre fighting style but his\nintentions are good if you get past his lack of bathing and his tendency to announce\nthat he has no money after eating at an inn or using the services of a prostitute.\n\nDirector Gosha is clearly the stylistic inspiration for many Italian western directors,\nmore so than Kurosawa. Too bad most spaghetti westerns never came close to this film.\n\nExcellent sword fighting, great photography, unique direction and a good cast.\n\n\n\n\nSAMURAI WOLF 2 (1967) - Kiba okaminosuke jigoku giri, L'enfer des sabres\n\nGood follow-up to &quot;Samurai Wolf&quot;, 21 April 2006\nAuthor: Chung Mo from NYC\n\nHighly enjoyable sequel to the excellent Samurai Wolf. &quot;Furious Wolf&quot; this time is\ncaught in the intrigue between a crooked gold mine owner and a mysterious swordsman\nwho resembles his long dead father. Once again there's a beautiful woman involved\nand lots of furious sword fights.\n\nThe Samurai Wolf films have a number of similarities to the Lone Wolf and Son series\nof the seventies and a bit of debt to the Zatoichi series. First, the eccentric sword\nwork of Furious Wolf is very much in the vein of Zatoichi while not imitating it.\nSecond, the geysers of blood that erupt from vanquished villains foretell the much\nmore absurd blood-letting of Lone Wolf.\n\nOnce again the photography is excellent and the cast is as good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0213685e01efd750b0f56346bb20e087cc1297aa","amp;dn":"Samurai+Wolf+1%2C2+%281966%2C1967%29+DVDrip+24fps+XviD+subs+ENG%2CFRE%2CESP%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0213685e01efd750b0f56346bb20e087cc1297aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,19,104,94,1,239,215,80,176,245,99,70,187,32,224,135,204,18,151,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
