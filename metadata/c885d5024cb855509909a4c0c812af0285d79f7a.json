Trying to combine hard science with populist telly, she asks the one big question ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ does it work? The answer is a qualified yes. She watches a woman having two teeth pulled out under hypnosis without any local anaesthetic. The patient feels virtually no pain and her pulse rate remains flat, while Professor Sykes is nearly sick. But there seems to be almost no scientific explanation as to how it works. Claims that it can help people to lose weight or give up smoking may be true, but ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ according to this programme ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no use when it comes to breast enhancement.
