Even so, it followed the plot of Dumas&amp;#039; novel fairly closely, its liberties in interpretation taken elsewhere. Coming off the success of Cabaret, Michael York plays D&amp;#039;Artagnan, the provincial, would-be swashbuckler who travels to Paris to make his name. There he encounters the eponymous heroes: cynical Athos (Oliver Reed), dashing Aramis (Richard Chamberlain), and arrogant Porthos (Frank Finlay). The trio introduces him to the world of court intrigue as they work to protect the Queen (Geraldine Chaplin) from the schemes of the villainous Richelieu (Charlton Heston) and his followers, Rochefort (Christopher Lee) and Milady (Faye Dunaway). Lester shot the film in conjunction with its sequel, The Four Musketeers. Originally intended as a single film, the split prompted a lawsuit from the cast demanding payment for both films.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072281/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072281/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSUBS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-2754&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-2754&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nRichard Lester\n\n\n\tOliver Reed\t... \tAthos\n\n\tRaquel Welch\t... \tConstance de Bonacieux\n\n\tRichard Chamberlain\t... \tAramis\n\n\tMichael York\t... \tD&amp;#039;Artagnan\n\tFrank Finlay\t... \tPorthos\n\n\tChristopher Lee\t... \tRochefort\n\tGeraldine Chaplin\t... \tAnna of Austria\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:42:34\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 656x368\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1842 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,31 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 1\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 96 Kbps\n\n\n\nENJOY  AND  SEED\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6eb92eea32d94ef48fd373ad3cb6aaa94451d123","amp;dn":"The+Three+Musketeers+%281973%29+Oliver+Reed.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6eb92eea32d94ef48fd373ad3cb6aaa94451d123","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,185,46,234,50,217,78,244,143,211,115,173,60,182,170,169,68,81,209,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
