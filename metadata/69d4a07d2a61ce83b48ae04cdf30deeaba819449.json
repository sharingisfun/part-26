But by 1814, an alliance of implacable enemies had conquered the ''Corsican ogre'' and banished him to the tiny island prison of Elba. Napoleon, however, was anything but defeated. Through cutting-edge imagery and powerful dramatic recreations, plunge into the chaos of 19th-century warfare and political intrigue as Napoleon mounts his last, whirlwind campaign. And witness the epic, history-changing battle that would bring a cataclysmic end to his dream of ruling the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69d4a07d2a61ce83b48ae04cdf30deeaba819449","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+-+Napoleon%27s+Final+Battle+%5B2006%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69d4a07d2a61ce83b48ae04cdf30deeaba819449","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,212,160,125,42,97,206,131,180,138,224,76,223,48,222,234,186,129,148,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
