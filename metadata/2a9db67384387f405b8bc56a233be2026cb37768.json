General information for each type of drug is given in detail, and all the alphabetical entries refer back to this section for descriptions of broad characteristics. The alphabetical listing of drugs that follows lists only substances &quot;which have been declared a public concern by government officials, medical caregivers, or news media.&quot; Each entry includes the pronunciation of the substance, the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (a unique identifier for every chemical), formal name or names, informal (&quot;street&quot;) names, the drug type, Federal Schedule Listing (which ranks drugs according to their potential for abuse), U.S. availability (e.g., prescription or illegal), and pregnancy category (based on the risk a drug poses to the fetus). Following this information, highly readable discussions cover uses, drawbacks, abuse factors, some drug interactions, cancer risk, pregnancy effects, and any additional information that seems pertinent. Both notes and reliable sources of additional scientific information are listed at the end of each of the entries.\n\nEntries are appropriately weighted. Nutmeg, for example, is a bit over two pages, while Marijuana runs to a little over eight (including two pages of informal names). A comprehensive list of print and Internet sources is included at the end of the volume, as are an exhaustive and accurate drug name index and a subject index.\n\nMore general and accessible than the Drug Abuse Handbook (CRC, 1998), The Encyclopedia of Addictive Drugs is recommended for high-school, academic, and large public libraries. It covers more addictive drugs than Gale's Drugs and Controlled Substances: Information for Students [RBB Mr 15 03], which is intended primarily for the high-school level.
