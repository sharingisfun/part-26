Archaeological evidence has shown that music, although there is no sure-fire way to know exactly what it sounded like, was just as important as a component of life in the Upper Paleolithic Age as it is today. In the Age of Discovery, Howard also charts the development of 'Gregorian' chant and advises that the style started with a handful of monks singing the same tune in unison, without rhythm and harmony. Over several centuries, medieval musicians painstakingly put together the basics of what is now known as harmony.\n\nPresenter/Howard Goodall","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a999e0a492d067c1ad46b9e97615abfcdf52d27d","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Story+of+Music+Episode+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a999e0a492d067c1ad46b9e97615abfcdf52d27d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,153,224,164,146,208,103,193,173,70,185,233,118,21,171,252,223,82,210,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
