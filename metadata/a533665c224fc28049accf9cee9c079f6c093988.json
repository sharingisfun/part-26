The quiet, subtle nature of the recording is a masterful example of key control and pedaling of which every pianist will want to take note. Performed on an 1885 Steinway, without the use of studio enhancements like equalization, compression, reverb or other digital effects the recordings were immediately sought after by audiophile manufacturers to demonstrate their gear. The sound is clear and immediate yet could put a baby to sleep.\nArt Lande is no stranger to recording, having released for ECM and Windham Hill; and performed with artists such as Charlie Haden, Woody Shaw, Jan Garbarek, Paul McCandless, Joe Henderson and Nguyen Le. He tours the world in various ensembles under his own name and as a popular sideman.\n&quot;This is truly a piano recording for piano lovers; I'm sure it's going to get plenty of playing at CES and other audio shows. Even the standard CD layer sonics are exemplary.&quot;\n-John Sunier, Audiophile Audition\nWhile She Sleeps was recorded to analog 2&quot; multitrack tape, mixed to both analog 1/2&quot; tape and Direct Stream Digital (DSD) for release on SACD and CD.
