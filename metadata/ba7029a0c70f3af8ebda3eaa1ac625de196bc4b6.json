Eventually I started sharing them freely with the world to help promote a more positive perception of martial arts in general. Also, I try to educate people as much as possible about martial arts, fitness, and health. This is because I have found that there is a lot of crap information out there about martial arts and fitness, and so much more good information. As a result, I ended up sifting through a lot of different articles and books, as well as trying out many different exercises and routines, and taking classes from different instructors. I wanted to make sure I could distill all of this experience into what works and how to progress in martial arts and fitness. The files in this torrent are the result.
