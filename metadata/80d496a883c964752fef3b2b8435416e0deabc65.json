The development of the surimi product crabstick in Japan in the 1970s played a major role in globalizing surimi and expanding surimi seafood consumption to the United States, Europe, and Russia. Commercial surimi production has also changed significantly. Surimi and Surimi Seafood, Third Edition covers the resources, production, technology, and nutrition of surimi and surimi seafood. Like the previous editions, this reference serves as a global surimi and surimi seafood industry guide.\r\n\r\nRevised and expanded, this new edition adds the most up-to-date information on the science of surimi and surimi seafood, with an increase from 17 to 23 chapters coauthored by 63 scientists and industry leaders. Presenting broader, more in-depth content, highlights include historical reviews of the surimi technology and industry, comminution technology and application, coproduct utilization, and nutrition and health benefits. The text examines topics related to surimi and fish proteins, including gelation chemistry, proteolytic enzymes, and stabilization of proteins.\r\n\r\nThis edition covers the production of various surimi seafood products: seafood paste, crabsticks, kamaboko, chikuwa, tempura, fish balls, and fish sausage. It discusses quality and production aspects, such as waste management, microbiology and pasteurization, ingredient technology, color measurement and colorants, seafood flavors, and sensory science applications. It also contains a chapter on research and development that can serve as a tool for insights on new product development","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80d496a883c964752fef3b2b8435416e0deabc65","amp;dn":"Surimi+and+Surimi+Seafood+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80d496a883c964752fef3b2b8435416e0deabc65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,212,150,168,131,201,100,117,47,239,59,43,132,53,65,110,13,234,188,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
