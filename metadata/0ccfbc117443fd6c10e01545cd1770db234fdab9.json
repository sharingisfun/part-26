Resonare Fibris; music and Solfeggio frequency 417 Hz.\n\nThe second tone, &quot;RE&quot; - short for &quot;resonare fibris&quot; or resonance - also correlates mathematically to 144,000.\n\n\nJezebelDecibel | 28 december, 2007 \n\n396 Hz Liberating Guilt and Fear.\nQuent Laxis is a healing audio and visual meditation with music, sacred geometry and Solfeggio frequency 396 Hz, the frequency for; Liberating Guilt and Fear.\n\nSolfeggio Frequency 396 Hz AKA Quent Laxis. 396 Hz is among the six core creative Solfeggio frequencies. The morphing drone and sine wave are tuned to 396 Hz the liberating frequency. This track renders a warm comforting, dreamy atmospheric space, to free the mind while floating the border of unisonic Theta and Delta brainwave entrainment.\n\nDr. Horowitz, a Harvard-trained award-winning investigator suggests that broadcasting the right frequency can help open your heart, prompt peace, and hasten healing. \n\n396 Hertz, is among the six core creative frequencies of the universe because math doesn't lie, the geometry of physical reality universally reflects this music; these findings have been independently derived, peer reviewed, and empirically validated,&quot; Dr. Horowitz says.\n\nMusic and video by Jandy (Decibel Jezebel)\n\nThe Solfeggio Scale and note names;\n\n1. UT...396 Hz (Center Pillar of the Tree)\n2. RE...417 Hz (Left Pillar of the Tree)\n*3. MI...528 Hz (Right Pillar of the Tree)*\n*4. FA...639 Hz (Center Pillar of the Tree)*\n*5. SOL..741 Hz (Left Pillar of the Tree)*\n*6. LA...852 Hz (Right Pillar of the Tree)*\n\nThe first note, &quot;UT quent laxis,&quot; is defined in Webster's Dictionary as &quot;the Gamut of dramatic emotion from grief to joy,&quot; and &quot;the whole series of recognized musical notes.&quot; It has a frequency of 396 cycles per second, and is also associated with a &quot;magnetic field strength equal to 105 power gauss,&quot; or 100,000.\n\nUT - 396 Hz -associated with releasing emotional patterns after: see RE-417Hz below.\nRE - 417 Hz -associated with breaking up crystallized emotional patterns.\n\nThe 3, 6, and 9.\nAs we look at the six original Solfeggio frequencies, using the Pythagorean method, we find the base or root vibrational numbers are 3,6, &amp; 9. Nicola Tesla tells us, and I quote: &quot;If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then you would have a key to the universe.&quot;\n\nwww.unisonicascension.com\n\n\n\n\n*NOT INCLUDED\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ccfbc117443fd6c10e01545cd1770db234fdab9","amp;dn":"Jezebel_Jandy_Solfeggio_Hz_Meditation_DeV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ccfbc117443fd6c10e01545cd1770db234fdab9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,207,188,17,116,67,253,108,16,224,21,69,205,23,112,219,35,79,218,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
