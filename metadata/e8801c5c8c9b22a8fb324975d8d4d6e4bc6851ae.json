Gerard Butler stars as Spartan King Leonidas and Lena Headey plays Queen Gorgo. The massive army of the Persian Empire is sweeping across the globe, crushing every force that dares stand in its path. When a Persian envoy arrives in Sparta offering King Leonidas power over all of Greece if he will only bow to the will of the all powerful Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), the strong-willed leader assembles a small army comprised of his empire\\'s best fighters and marches off to battle. Though they have virtually no hope of defeating Xerxes\\' intimidating battalion, Leonidas\\' men soldier on, intent on letting it be known they will bow to no man but their king. Meanwhile, back in Sparta, the loyal Queen Gorgo attempts to convince both the skeptical council and the devious Theron (Dominic West) to send more troops despite the fact that many view Leonidas\\' unsanctioned war march as a serious transgression. As Xerxes\\' fearsome \\&quot;immortals\\&quot; draw near, a few noble Greeks vow to assist the Spartans on the battlefield. When King Leonidas and his 300 Spartan warriors fell to the overwhelming Persian army at the Battle of Thermopylae, the fearless actions of the noble fighters inspired all of Greece to stand up against their Persian enemy and wage the battle that would ultimately give birth to the modern concept of democracy. \n\n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter and Autogk.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8801c5c8c9b22a8fb324975d8d4d6e4bc6851ae","amp;dn":"300%282007%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8801c5c8c9b22a8fb324975d8d4d6e4bc6851ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,128,28,92,140,155,34,168,251,50,73,117,216,212,214,228,188,104,81,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
