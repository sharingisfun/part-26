It is not only the oldest, but it is also the fastest rally in North America. With roads consisting of clay and gravel, the course is slippery, fast and extremely dangerous. Drivers travel at speeds reaching 100 MPH through densely wooded roads. The speeds combined with the dangerous course ensure that this rally is not for the faint at heart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f50e14d857ae1e0108989c7d607c7df4717bad3c","amp;dn":"Rally+America+-+2014+STPR+Recap","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f50e14d857ae1e0108989c7d607c7df4717bad3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,14,20,216,87,174,30,1,8,152,156,125,96,124,125,244,113,123,173,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
