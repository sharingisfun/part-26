I'm back with a new batch of one-page pieces, submitted for your approval, disapproval, or total indifference.  You don't have to care about what I write -- that's my job.  Hobby.  Whatever.  Inside you'll find polemics against religion, war, and other evils of the world, musings on science and death, the occasional poem.  So if you're into that sort of thing, go nuts.  Download this, print it out, etc.\n\nAll of my previous work can be accessed by clicking on my username, above.  This is probably also an appropriate time to mention that the final essay of Pirate This Book (Part V) contains a rather egregious error regarding the chronology of the Old Testament, although I won't go so far as to tell you exactly what it is.  Instead I'll let it stand as a testament (groan) to human ignorance.  Spot it if you can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae74a3be63229bc6498df01a93454662e8f7d172","amp;dn":"Pirate+This+2%3A+Howling+into+the+Aether+%28Part+I%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae74a3be63229bc6498df01a93454662e8f7d172","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,116,163,190,99,34,155,198,73,141,240,26,147,69,70,98,232,247,209,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
