It is one of the most popular ska bands in Spain and Europe.\n\nMusically, despite their fun image, Ska-P has well-rehearsed and tight arrangements, and as of 2002, includes among its members a small but striking brass section which gives the band a powerful sound.\n\nTheir nonconformist attitude is also evident in their eccentric haircuts. Some band members have mohawks while others are almost bald-shaven (with a ponytail at the back).\n\nAt the end of 2004, they announced work on a new album. After voting 4 against 2, in February 2005, the sudden and unexpected announcement was made that the band would take a break to allow the members to work on side projects, though some considered the band to have dissolved. The band&amp;#039;s worldwide farewell tour of 2005 ended in Buenos Aires, Argentina in October of that year. Their farewell concert in LeganÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s (near Madrid), on September 24 2005, filled the 10,000-seat La Cubierta Stadium.\n\nIn April 2008 the band confirmed they were getting back together and on September 5th, 2008 released the single &quot;Crimen sollicitationis&quot;. This was followed in October 2008 by a new album, LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡grimas y Gozos (Tears and Joys), which was released on October 7, 2008. The release of the album would be followed by a brief tour.[1]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:335fb7e2df1f6b7b0545c6da01e71957722c4004","amp;dn":"Ska-P+%28ska+punk%29+Concert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"335fb7e2df1f6b7b0545c6da01e71957722c4004","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,95,183,226,223,31,107,123,5,69,198,218,1,231,25,87,114,44,64,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
