Saved from destruction, read, and annotated by Byron's own abandoned daughter, Ada, the manuscript is rediscovered in our time -- and almost not recognized. Lord Byron's Novel is the story of a dying daughter's attempt to understand the famous father she longed for -- and the young woman who, by learning the secret of Byron's manuscript and Ada's devotion, reconnects with her own father, driven from her life by a crime as terrible as any of which Byron himself was accused.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f69bdeddfa3089f8367406fc89b0c3125f2e5323","amp;dn":"Lord+Byron%27s+Novel-+The+Evening+Land+by+John+Crowley+%28retail%29+%7Bd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f69bdeddfa3089f8367406fc89b0c3125f2e5323","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,155,222,221,250,48,137,248,54,116,6,252,137,176,195,18,95,46,83,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
