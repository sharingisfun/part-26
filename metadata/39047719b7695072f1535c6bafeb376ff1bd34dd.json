Where the most powerful drop of the entire EP hits you in the face like Hurricane Sandy hit New York (too soon?) the track then fades down in the original theme to utter darkness.\n\nThe Answer is Always a Piano is a more laid-back song despite having a big thumping four on the floor bass drum. With pianos playing little tickling melodies, and a duo of synth leads harmonizing into a beautiful story telling solo constantly conversing with one another until the very end of the track. \n\n\nI put a year's worth of work into these four tracks, so I sincerely hope you enjoy it.
