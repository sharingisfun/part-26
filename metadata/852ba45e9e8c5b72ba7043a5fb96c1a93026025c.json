I recommend the 5.50 GEN D3 Firmware. The game is excellent - working 100% on my phat PSP (PSP-1002), running off the Memory Stick (via an ISO Loader).\n\nSeed the ISO, go buy a beer and enjoy! If you like the game please don't forget to support the software developers by buying a GENUINE copy of it! However, you can always try before you buy! :)\n\nEnjoy this fine release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:852ba45e9e8c5b72ba7043a5fb96c1a93026025c","amp;dn":"Hatsune+Miku%3A+Project+Diva+%28PSP%2C+Japanese+ISO%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"852ba45e9e8c5b72ba7043a5fb96c1a93026025c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,43,164,94,158,140,91,114,186,112,67,165,251,150,193,169,48,38,2,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
