Using a step-by-step approach, author Kevin Skoglund presents the commands that enable efficient code management and reveals the fundamental concepts behind version control systems and the Git architecture. Discover how to track changes to files in a repository, review previous edits, and compare versions of a file; create branches to test new ideas without altering the main project; and merge those changes into the project if they work out. The course begins by demonstrating version control in a single-user, standalone context, before exploring how remote repositories allow users to collaborate on projects effectively.\nTopics include:\n\nExploring the history of version control\nInstalling Git on Mac, Windows, and Linux\nInitializing a repository\nWriting useful commit messages\nUnderstanding the Git three-tree architecture\nTracking when files are added, edited, deleted, or moved\nViewing change sets and comparing versions\nUndoing changes and rolling back to previous versions\nIgnoring changes to select files\nCreating and working with code branches\nMerging branches and resolving merge conflicts\nStashing changes for later\nWorking with hosted repositories and remote branches\nDeveloping an effective collaboration workflow","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8898534e79b295b26db975a7255ceba3390f0bc","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+Git+Essential+Training.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8898534e79b295b26db975a7255ceba3390f0bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,137,133,52,231,155,41,91,38,219,151,90,114,85,206,186,51,144,240,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
