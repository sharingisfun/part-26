Spend a week with the young inhabitants of a camp bent on molding campers into fun and interesting people via pranks, food fights, greased watermelon relays. \n\nAlong the way, you'll meet Dave and Holly, totalitarian head counselors who may be getting too old for this shit, Bernadette, a Luddite chaplain with some kids to convert, Billy, a first-timer tasting freedom, and Tad, a shaggy dude with a Jesus complex. Prank hard, joke loud, break a bone or two: Half a forest got burned down for you to live it up.\n\nGenre: General Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79fbc8a02cc4e0976d23e5722e79923b7c083dd1","amp;dn":"Fun+Camp+by+Gabe+Durham","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79fbc8a02cc4e0976d23e5722e79923b7c083dd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,251,200,160,44,196,224,151,109,35,229,114,46,121,146,59,124,8,61,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
