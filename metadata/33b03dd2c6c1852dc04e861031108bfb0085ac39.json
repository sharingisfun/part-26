Hernandez - Gilbert, Jaime, Mario\n\nTo a very great extent, Love and Rockets is synonymous with Hoppers' Maggie &amp; Hopey and Palomar's Luba &amp; Carmen &amp; Heraclio &amp; Tonantzin... but there was always more to L&amp;R than that. Amor Y Cohetes finally collects together in one convenient package all the non-Maggie and non-Palomar stories by all three Hernandez Brothers from that classic first, 50-issue Love and Rockets series Ã¢â‚¬â€ a dizzying array of styles and approaches that re-confirms these groundbreaking cartoonists' place in the history of comics.\n\nThe book leads off with Gilbert's original 40-page sci-fi epic Ã¢â‚¬Å“BEMÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from 1981's very first issue of Love and Rockets, featuring a very different Luba and a much looser, Heavy Metal- and Marvel Comics-inspired way of storytelling.\n\nOther stories include Jaime's charming Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rocky and FumbleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ series starring a planet-hopping girl and her robot; stunning one-shots such as Gilbert's Frida Kahlo biography Ã¢â‚¬Å“FridaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and his shocking autobiographical fantasia Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Love BookÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; MarioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genre thrillers which take place Ã¢â‚¬Å“Somewhere in CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; Gilbert's brutally dystopian Ã¢â‚¬Å“Errata StigmataÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ stories; the playful Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hernandez Satyricon,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with Gilbert drawing Jaime's characters, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“War Paint,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with Jaime trying out Palomar; Gilbert's light-hearted Ã¢â‚¬Å“Music for MonstersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ starring Bang and Inez; and even a fantastical Ã¢â‚¬Å“non-continuityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Maggie and Hopey story Ã¢â‚¬Å“Easter HuntÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Jaime that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fit into the other books.\n\nAmor Y Cohetes, the seventh (and concluding, for now) volume in the new Ã¢â‚¬Å“Complete Love and RocketsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shows a very different side of Los Bros Hernandez.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33b03dd2c6c1852dc04e861031108bfb0085ac39","amp;dn":"Amor+Y+Cohetes+-+The+Love+and+Rockets+Library","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33b03dd2c6c1852dc04e861031108bfb0085ac39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,176,61,210,198,193,133,45,192,78,134,16,49,16,139,251,0,133,172,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
