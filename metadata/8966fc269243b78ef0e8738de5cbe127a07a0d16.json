I will preserve the original copy-text that the OP used on TheBox.bz where I found / stole it, but for the sake of clarity, here is the basic concept: Theologians and literary critics have been discussing and debating for fifty years on the merit and possible deeper meaning of C.S. LewisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ work, particularly The Chronicles of Narnia. Recently in 2003, a student in England was reading a Lewis poem on medieval cosmology (remember that Lewis was a professor of that periodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s literature), and suddenly realized that the poem was synopsis of the entire seven book series, and thus the series was predicated on the medieval European concept of the Cosmos ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ hence the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNarnia CodeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nIn any event, this documentary is beautifully produced and quite thought provoking. All C.S. Lewis fans should greatlt enjoy this.\n\nRambam1776 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ props to the OP on thebox.\n\n\n---------------\n\nThe Narnia Code\n\nThursday, 16th April 2009\n10:35pm to 11:35pm\nBBC1\n\nIt's well known that CS Lewis's Narnia Chronicles work at two levels - the fairy story and the Christian allegory. This documentary examines claims that there is a deeper hidden third layer that brings the works together as a whole and brings new meaning to the collection.\n\nCS Lewis wrote the Narnia Chronicles over 50 years ago, yet they are more popular today than ever. When they were first published, many critics thought them little more than childish scribblings, replete with random characters and unexplained events. Even Lewis's good friend JRR Tolkien thought them confused and misconceived.\n\nOther scholars were sure there was something more, something hidden beneath the stories. Although many tried, none could find this secret key of Narnia - until now. Reverend Dr Michael Ward, a young academic and expert in all things Lewisian, claims he has found the answer at last: he has discovered the Narnia Code.\n\nUsing dramatisations of Lewis's early life and career, the programme travels the world, from the Mid-West of modern America to the battlefields of the First World War, meeting experts, testing evidence and uncovering surprising questions and ideas that still challenge readers today. The trouble comes when these experts start to use the new overarching religious themes in the Narnia Chronicles to try to explain questions of cosmology and science that they have no right to get involved with.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8966fc269243b78ef0e8738de5cbe127a07a0d16","amp;dn":"The+Narnia+Code++BBC3+-+What+is+Narnia+REALLY+about%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8966fc269243b78ef0e8738de5cbe127a07a0d16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,102,252,38,146,67,183,142,240,232,115,141,229,203,225,39,160,122,13,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
