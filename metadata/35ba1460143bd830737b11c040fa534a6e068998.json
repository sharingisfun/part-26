They recorded from 1963 through 1975, and continued to perform until Hatfield&amp;#039;s death in 2003. Their emotive vocal stylings were sometimes dubbed &quot;blue-eyed soul&quot;. Medley and Hatfield both possessed exceptional vocal talent, with range, control and tone that helped them create a strong and distinct duet sound and also to perform as soloists. Medley sang the low parts with his deep, soulful bass-baritone, with Hatfield taking the higher register vocals with his soaring tenor.\nThey adopted their name in 1962 while performing together in the Los Angeles area as part of a five-member group called The Paramours, which featured John Wimber, one of the founders of the Vineyard Movement, on keyboards. At the end of one particular performance, a black Marine in the audience shouted, &quot;That was righteous, brothers!&quot;, prompting the pair to adopt the name when they embarked on a career as a duo.\n\nUNCHAINED MELODY (The Righteous Brothers)\n\nOh my love my darling\nI&amp;#039;ve hungered for your touch\nA long lonely time\nAnd time goes by so slowly\nAnd time can do so much\nAre you still mine\nI need your love\nI need your love\nGod speed your love to me\n\nLonely rivers flow to the sea to the sea\nTo the open arms of the sea\nLonely rivers sigh wait for me wait for me\nI&amp;#039;ll be coming home wait for me\n\nOh my love my darling\nI&amp;#039;ve hungered hungered for your touch\nA long lonely time\nAnd time goes by so slowly\nAnd time can do so much\nAre you still mine\nI need your love\nI need your love\nGod speed your love to me ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35ba1460143bd830737b11c040fa534a6e068998","amp;dn":"The+Righteous+Brothers+-+Unchained+Melody","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35ba1460143bd830737b11c040fa534a6e068998","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,186,20,96,20,59,216,48,115,123,17,192,64,250,83,74,110,6,137,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
