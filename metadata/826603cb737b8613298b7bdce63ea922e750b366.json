When World War 2 began, it was decided to use similar tactics, and nine disguised raiders were sent out alongside Germany's small number of major warships to prey on enemy shipping. All were eventually hunted down, but not until almost 200 Allied ships had been sunk.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2267 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 44:46.411\nNumber Of Parts: 26\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:826603cb737b8613298b7bdce63ea922e750b366","amp;dn":"HC.History%27s.Raiders.24of26.German.Commerce.Raiders.XviD.AC3..av","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"826603cb737b8613298b7bdce63ea922e750b366","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,102,3,203,115,123,134,19,41,139,123,220,230,62,169,34,231,80,179,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
