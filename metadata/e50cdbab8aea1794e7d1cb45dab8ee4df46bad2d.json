Flight Dynamics provides all three in an accessible and student focussed text.\n\nWritten for those coming to the subject for the first time the book is suitable as a complete first course text. It provides a secure foundation from which to move on to more advanced topics such a non-linear flight dynamics, simulation and advanced flight control, and is ideal for those on course including flight mechanics, aircraft handling qualities, aircraft stability and control.\n\nEnhances by detailed worked examples, case studies and aircraft operating condition software, this complete course text, by a renowned flight dynamicist, is widely used on aircraft engineering courses\n\n.Suitable as a complete first course text, it provides a secure foundation from which to move on to more advanced topics such a non-linear flight dynamics, simulation and advanced flight control\n.End of chapter exercises, detailed worked examples, and case studies aid understanding and relate concepts to real world applications\n.Covers key contemporary topics including all aspects of optimization, emissions, regulation and automatic flight control and UAVs\n.Accompanying MathCAD software source code for performance model generation and optimization\n.Instructor's Manual and image bank for downloading by registered instructors available online\nFrom the Back Cover\nThe study of flight dynamics requires a\nthorough understanding of the theory of the\nstability and control of aircraft, an\nappreciation of flight control systems and a\ncomprehensive grounding in the theory of\nautomatic control.
