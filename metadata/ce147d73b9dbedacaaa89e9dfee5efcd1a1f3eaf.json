This UNDUB has\n  the USA english text with the original Japanese spoken dialog. \n\n  Now includes the complete set of voices from the Director&amp;#039;s Cut\n  version released in Japan.\n\n  Enjoy this game the way it was meant to be played!\n\n\n                    -- Release Notes --\n\n  Well, I&amp;#039;ve been sitting on this for a year but never felt like\n  testing it much since I hate the game now.  I&amp;#039;m out of storage\n  and need to do some spring cleaning though, so time to get rid\n  of it.  Since people keep bugging me about the director&amp;#039;s cut\n  voices, you can all be testers instead of me ;).\n\n  Event, battle, movie and field chatter are Japanese.  I believe\n  there may be minor inconsistencies between the JP voices and the\n  english script.  I don&amp;#039;t think there&amp;#039;s a very good way to deal\n  with that, but if you run into major problems post a save game\n  somewhere and I may take a look.\n\n  As before, this is a typical DVD5 conversion with duplicate data\n  eliminated and the credits movie killed.  All other movies are\n  the RG DC originals.\n\n  Hackers/coders want to contact me?  Look for a fluffy kitty.\n\n\n                    *** USA PUBLISHERS ***\n\n  Please stop ruining your games with such horrible english dubs!\n  We are forced to go to extremes like this because you are making\n  the games we love unplayable!\n\n  Consider multi-language or special-edition releases with the\n  original high quality Japanese voices.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce147d73b9dbedacaaa89e9dfee5efcd1a1f3eaf","amp;dn":"Rogue+Galaxy+USA+UNDUB+1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce147d73b9dbedacaaa89e9dfee5efcd1a1f3eaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,20,125,115,185,219,237,172,170,168,158,157,254,229,239,205,26,31,62,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
