Black probes the diverse character of military capability and the varied nature of military change. The history of war is inextricably bound to the history of the world and for us, as human beings, warfare has often proved to be the pivotal cause, means and consequence of change within society. Through a detailed exploration of 'world-scale' issues of warfare, presented within a chronological framework that spans human history, Jeremy Black skilfully illustrates this fact whilst providing the reader with other astute insights and compelling interpretations of war. &quot;War: A Short History&quot; is a dramatic move away from the formulaic, western approach to military history. Too narrow in its focus on wars specific to the west and too simple because of an over-reliance on a technologically-deterministic reading of warfare, this approach has been rejected by Jeremy Black in favour of a global model that takes all factors into account when considering the strengths and weaknesses of a particular military tradition. Examining wars on five continents, Jeremy Black expertly introduces readers to all of the major themes of warfare. This is a book that is as important for its relevance to current world issues of conflict as it is for its thorough consideration of a monumentally significant aspect of human history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e812f8466e0de9298b7a8b83c473e695ca47c91","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+War+A+Short+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e812f8466e0de9298b7a8b83c473e695ca47c91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,129,47,132,102,224,222,146,152,183,168,184,60,71,62,105,92,164,124,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
