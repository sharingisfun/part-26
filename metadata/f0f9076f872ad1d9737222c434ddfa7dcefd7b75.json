Lindsay discovers that not only is there no trace of the criminals - but that the victim may be keeping secrets.\n\nAt the same time, Assistant District Attorney Yuki Castellano is prosecuting the biggest case of her life - a woman who has been accused of murdering her husband in front of her two young children. Yuki's career rests on a guilty verdict, so when Lindsay finds evidence that could save the defendant, she is forced to choose. Should she trust her best friend or follow her instinct?\n\nLindsay's every move is watched by her new boss, Lieutenant Jackson Brady, and when the pressure to find the baby starts interfering with her new marriage to Joe, she wonders if she'll ever be able to start a family of her own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0f9076f872ad1d9737222c434ddfa7dcefd7b75","amp;dn":"10th+Anniversary+by+James+Patterson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0f9076f872ad1d9737222c434ddfa7dcefd7b75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,249,7,111,135,42,209,217,115,114,34,196,52,221,250,125,206,253,123,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
