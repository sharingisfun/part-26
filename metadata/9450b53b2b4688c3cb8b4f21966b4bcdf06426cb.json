Krull's generalization of absolute values to valuations made possible applications in other branches of mathematics. In valuation theory, the notion of completion must be replaced by that of &quot;Henselization&quot;. This book develops the theory of valuations as well as of Henselizations, based on the skills of a standard graduate course in algebra.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9450b53b2b4688c3cb8b4f21966b4bcdf06426cb","amp;dn":"Valued+Fields","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9450b53b2b4688c3cb8b4f21966b4bcdf06426cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,80,181,59,43,70,136,195,203,139,79,33,150,107,75,205,240,100,38,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
