It has chaotic bullet-hell shoot-'em-up gameplay similar to that of the first two games, but it's also wildly different. The action is now scrolling vertically, and you'll be taking control of an array of deadly self-destructive flying dolls. Each one has its own game-changing abilities. You'll have to decide which to use, when they'll fight on, and when it's time for them to make the ultimate crash-and-burn sacrifice.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 6 stages of vertical-scrolling bullet insanity\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sweet old-school retro anime-style art\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 8 playable characters, and 4 unlockable characters\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 2 unlockable special modes\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 13 Steam achievements\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Full online leaderboards\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ New arranged soundtrack by Woofle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67412f017e4333b7f4a5b0052a33faf7edc8effa","amp;dn":"Hitogata.Happa.RIP-Unleashed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67412f017e4333b7f4a5b0052a33faf7edc8effa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,65,47,1,126,67,51,183,244,165,176,5,42,51,250,247,237,200,239,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
