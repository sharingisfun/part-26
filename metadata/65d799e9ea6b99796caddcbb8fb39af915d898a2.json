Forget the fairy-tale, hocus-pocus, wave a wand and bling-o, sparkles and pixie dust crap. Magic, like booze, sex, and drugs, gave as good as it got.\r\nEverything has a cost. And every act of magic exacts a price from its user â€“ maybe a two-day migraine, or losing the memory of your first kiss. But some people want to use magic without paying, and they Offload the cost onto innocents. When that happens, it falls to a Hound to identify the spellâ€™s caster â€“ and Allison Beckstromâ€™s the best there is.\r\nDaughter of a prominent Portland businessman, Allie would rather moonlight as a Hound than accept the family fortune â€“ and the strings that come with it. But when she discovers a little boy dying from a magic Offload that has her fatherâ€™s signature all over it, Allie is thrown into the high-stakes world of corporate espionage and black magic.\r\nNow Allieâ€™s out for the truth â€“ and must call upon forces that will challenge everything she knows, change her in ways she could never imagine â€¦ and make her capable of things that powerful people will do anything to control","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65d799e9ea6b99796caddcbb8fb39af915d898a2","amp;dn":"Devon+Monk%3A+The+Allie+Beckstrom+series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65d799e9ea6b99796caddcbb8fb39af915d898a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,215,153,233,234,107,153,121,108,173,220,187,143,179,154,249,21,216,152,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
