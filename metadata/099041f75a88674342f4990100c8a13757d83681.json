The landscape of our cities was desolate and bleak, the 60s social housing experiment had gone wrong and had created a realm of brutalist concrete high rises and estates. UK Decay was most definitely here and the hideous possibilities of JG Ballard's visions were coming to life. \n\nOut of the wreckage of the late 70s, were a number of like minded bands who took their inspiration from all this bleakness. One being Basement 5, welding punk rage and dubwise rydims together, they could get any pessimist's party started and along with Killing Joke with their blend of &quot;fascistic&quot; millerian nihilism and industrial strength riffage both bands created a suitable soundtrack to all this 80s alienation. \n\nLegendary Roxy DJ Don Letts was briefly vocalist but by 1979 he'd been replaced by rock photographer Dennis Morris and with J.R. on bass, Leo on guitar and ex-101'er and PIL sticksman Richard Dudanski on drums, this was the line up that would record their only (proper ) album released by Island Records in 1980.\n\n\nEntitled 1965 -1980 (1960 being the date Morris came over to England, from Jamacia, I think)and produced by sonic alchemist Martin Hannett, the much feted producer was unable to create an unique sonic soundscape for the Basement 5 as he did for Joy Division, (apparently island were unhappy with the final mix) but whatever, he did conjure up a sympathetic enough canvas to accomodate the seething resentment, dub noise and sheet metal riffage into a mighty sound. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:099041f75a88674342f4990100c8a13757d83681","amp;dn":"Basement+5+-+1965-1980%2FBasement+5+In+Dub+%5B1992%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"099041f75a88674342f4990100c8a13757d83681","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,144,65,247,90,136,103,67,66,244,153,1,0,200,161,55,87,216,54,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
