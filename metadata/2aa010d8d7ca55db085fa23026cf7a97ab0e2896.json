He has attracted attention for his eccentric image, his accidental acting career, his beguiling good looks, and his quirky charm. In Johnny Depp Starts Here, film scholar Murray Pomerance explores our fascination with Depp, his riddling complexity, and his meaning for our culture. Moving beyond the actor's engaging and inscrutable private life, Pomerance focuses on his enigmatic screen performances from A Nightmare on Elm Street to Secret Window. The actor's image is studied in terms of its ambiguities and its many strange nuances: Depp's ethnicity, his smoking, his tranquility, his unceasing motion, his links to the Gothic, the Beats, Simone de Beauvoir, the history of rationality, Impressionist painting, and more. In a series of treatments of his key roles, including Rafael in The Brave, Bon Bon in Before Night Falls, Jack Kerouac in The Source, and the long list of acclaimed performances from Gilbert Grape to Cap'n Jack Sparrow, we learn of Johnny onscreen in terms of male sexuality, space travel, optical experience, nineteenth-century American capitalism, Orientalism, the vulnerability of performance, the perils of sleep, comedy, the myth of the West, Scrooge McDuck, Francois Truffaut, and more. Johnny's face, Johnny's gaze, Johnny's aging, and Johnny's understatement are shown to be inextricably linked to our own desperate need to plumb performance, style, and screen for a grounding of reality in this everaccelerating world of fragmentation and insecurity. Both deeply intriguing and perpetually elusive, Depp is revealed as the central screen performer of the contemporary age, the symbol of performance itself. No thinker has meditated on Johnny Depp this way before - and surely not in a manner worthly of the object of scrutiny.\n\nReview\n&quot;Johnny Depp Starts Here offers an important contribution to the field of star studies, not only for its unique treatment of Depp's elusiveness, but also for its author's captivating validation of the experience of watching and of discovering connections that provide him with pleasure. Pomerance's passion is highly contagious.&quot; - Michael DeAngelis, DePaul University; &quot;Pomerance is the inimitable lyric poet of cinema scholars, bringing the imagination of a creative artist and the rigor of an exacting intellect to these masterly riffs on Depp's complexities and conundrums. The protean actor could not have found a commentator more in tune with his mercurial career and elusive, mesmerizing self.&quot; - David Sterritt, author of Mad to Be Saved: The Beats, the '50s, and Film&quot;\n\nAbout the Author\nMurray Pomerance, professor and chair in the department of sociology at Ryerson University, is the author of An Eye for Hitchcock and Magia D'Amore and the editor of BAD: Infamy, Darkness, Evil, and Slime on Screen and American Cinema of the 1950s: Themes and Variations.\n\nPublisher: Rutgers University Press (30 April 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0813535654\nISBN-13: 978-0813535654","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aa010d8d7ca55db085fa23026cf7a97ab0e2896","amp;dn":"Johnny+Depp+Starts+Here+%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aa010d8d7ca55db085fa23026cf7a97ab0e2896","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,160,16,216,215,202,85,219,8,95,162,48,38,207,122,151,171,14,40,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
