Created in 1975 by Steve Gerber and Mary Skrenes, the original Omega The Unknown lasted only ten issues but was a legend to those who recall it -- an ahead-of-its-time tale of an anti-hero, inflected with brilliant ambiguity.\n\nOne of Omega's teenage fans was award-winning novelist Jonathan Lethem, who has used the original as a springboard for a superbly strange, funny, and moving graphic novel in ten chapters.\n\nThe series was nominated in the &quot;Best Limited Series&quot; and &quot;Best Lettering&quot; categories in the 2009 Eisner Award. An excerpt was selected by Neil Gaiman to be anthologized in The Best American Comics 2010.\n\nOmega the Unknown v1 #1-10: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7810350/Omega_the_Unknown__1-10_(1976-1977)_[Marvel]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7810350/Omega_the_Unknown__1-10_(1976-1977)_[Marvel]&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98b1bcdfa468dce375fc57ca5faa10016ad0d8b0","amp;dn":"Omega+the+Unknown+v2+%231-10+%282007-2008%29+%5BMarvel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98b1bcdfa468dce375fc57ca5faa10016ad0d8b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,177,188,223,164,104,220,227,117,252,87,202,95,170,16,1,106,208,216,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
