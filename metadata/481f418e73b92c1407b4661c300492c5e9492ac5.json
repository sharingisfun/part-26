Brothers Li Yi (Wei Dong) and Li Er (Wu Dezhou) are brought to the elite wushu school by their father Li Hui (Sammo Hung). There they meet Fong Fong (Liu Xin), Zhang Xiao (Shi Yao) and Yang Yauwu (Liang Zhicheng) and, as the film evolves, we see them grow up together, become life-long friends and eventually form a gang they call Jin Wu Men. The five train hard to prepare for the selection competition for the provincial team but their focus shifts when they meet Ke Le (Tie Nan), a previous top student in the school expelled for seriously injuring a schoolmate in a fight. It turns out Ke is the head of a child-kidnapping organization, and Li Yi, Li Hui and Yang Yauwu must risk their lives to save the kidnapped children as well as Li Er.\n\nResolution: 608x256\nDuration: 1:38:10\nVideo Codec: Xvid\nData Rate: 975kbps\nAudio Codec: mP3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kbps\n\nChinese Language\nEnglish Hard Sub\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:481f418e73b92c1407b4661c300492c5e9492ac5","amp;dn":"Wushu%5B2008%5DDvdrip%5BEng-Hard-Sub%5D-Salem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"481f418e73b92c1407b4661c300492c5e9492ac5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,31,65,142,115,185,44,20,7,180,102,28,48,4,146,197,233,73,42,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
