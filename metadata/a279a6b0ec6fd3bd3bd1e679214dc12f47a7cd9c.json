And then disaster strikes the caravan, again. Luckily they break down outside a pub.\n\nThe next day finds them at the beautiful Camel Valley vineyard where, despite the typical August weather, rain, they enjoy tasting proper English wine.\n\nFinally they head for a delightful Cornish pub serving delicious Cornish beer. Oz has a surprise in store for James, which unfortunately for Oz backfires in a way he could not have predicted.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a279a6b0ec6fd3bd3bd1e679214dc12f47a7cd9c","amp;dn":"Oz+and+James+Drink+to+Britain+-+S01E07+-+17+Feb+2009+%5BREMAX%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a279a6b0ec6fd3bd3bd1e679214dc12f47a7cd9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,121,166,176,236,111,211,189,59,209,230,121,33,77,193,47,71,167,205,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
