From his early days as a sideman for Charlie Parker, through his groundbreaking Birth of the Cool sessions, to his stunning small groups of the &amp;#039;50s and &amp;#039;60s, through to his electric renaissance, the trumpeter, bandleader, and composer has left a deep mark on all who came after. He is one of jazz&amp;#039;s true giants. Sketches of Spain, though one of Davis&amp;#039;s most commercially successful sessions, is also one of his most controversial. Re-teaming with arranger and composer Gil Evans, who played such a pivotal role in Davis&amp;#039;s 1949 Birth of the Cool recordings, Davis recorded a series of large group albums beginning in the late &amp;#039;50s, including Porgy and Bess, Miles Ahead, and Quiet Nights. Sketches of Spain, with its emphasis on flamenco, rich orchestrations, and relaxed tempos, is certainly one of Davis&amp;#039;s most mellow recordings (he even works out on fluegelhorn), and proved to have broad appeal. To some critics, however, the project was &quot;elevated elevator music.&quot; An expanded version of the album, featuring alternative tracks and unreleased material, was issued in 1997 by Columbia Legacy.&quot;-Fred Goodman\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0780f44e2a9814ae900749a7f0f88f20a20b800","amp;dn":"Miles+Davies+%7E+Sketches+of+Spain+%281967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0780f44e2a9814ae900749a7f0f88f20a20b800","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,120,15,68,226,169,129,74,233,0,116,154,127,15,136,242,10,32,184,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
