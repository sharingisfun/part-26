Minus the fuss and muss of the overly boisterous fare blared in most public places from Thanksgiving through New Year's, Cardall's song cycle cuts to the core of what this season is all about. Deft arrangements of carols and original compositions, warmly articulated piano pieces tastefully augmented by strings and simple production help to vest these songs with quiet wonder and simple grace. And thankfully, we are spared the marring these lovely tunes by vocals. The Christmas Box perfectly captures moods of the darkening days of winter, and is a welcome antidote to the gaudy commercialization of a season of Spirit. Come December, this is the record to smooth frayed nerves and refocus one's sense of gratitude.\n\n.mp3\n320 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb71e003bc460f91f597935aeef5de378cd82676","amp;dn":"Paul+Cardall+-+The+Christmas+Box","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb71e003bc460f91f597935aeef5de378cd82676","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,113,224,3,188,70,15,145,245,151,147,90,238,245,222,55,140,216,38,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
