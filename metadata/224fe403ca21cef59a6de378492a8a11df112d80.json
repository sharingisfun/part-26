She makes ends meet and pays for her son's school fees by cooking for old ladies and sleeping with a small syndicate of adoring men (the &quot;peacocks&quot; of the title - from Greek mythology). The story revolves around Hebe, her &quot;clients&quot; and their families, and set against a backdrop of village life in South-West England. There is a sub-theme of the antiques trade which draws some of the characters together, and ultimately resolves the mystery of Hebe's masked lover.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:224fe403ca21cef59a6de378492a8a11df112d80","amp;dn":"Harnessing+Peacocks+%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"224fe403ca21cef59a6de378492a8a11df112d80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,79,228,3,202,33,206,245,154,109,227,120,73,42,138,17,223,17,45,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
