Combining elements of classically influenced &quot;Musique Concrete&quot;, &quot;Found Sound&quot; or &quot;Sampling&quot; techniques (introduced by bassist/radio wave scanner Holger Czukay, LONG BEFORE Brian Eno who takes credit for introducing these elements to rock shame on him), modern classical chamber music, extended psychedelic jams, concise hard rocking tunes, jazz influenced improvisations with spoken word or beautifully melodic vocals.  In Can there was one of those &quot;Once in a lifetime&quot; coming together of people from extremely different backgrounds (Guitarist Michael Karoli from the rock scene, Drummer Jacki Liebezeit from the avant garde jazz scene, Keyboardist Irmin Schmidt from classical academia and an acomplished conductor in his own right, bassist Holger Czukay also from the acedemic classical scene who studied with Karlheinz Stockhausen, vocalists Malcolm Lowery, first vocalist who left in the early years, and Damo Suzuki, with Can the longest from the US and Japan respectively) that became a bubbling cauldron of genre defying collaboration that sounds relevant 30-odd years later.\n\nThe albums are:\n\nEge Bamyasi\nFlow Motion\nFuture Days\nLanded\nLive Music 1971-1977 Disc 1\nLive Music 1971-1977 Disc 2\nMonster Movie (SACD) remasterd\nOut Of Reach\nRadio Waves\nRite Time\nSacrilege\nSaw Delight\nSoon Over Babaluma\nSoundtracks\nTago Mago\nThe Peel Sessions\nUnlimited Edition\n\nEnjoy and Please seed!;-}\n\nJunco","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f2a2614d39e2fd588d3844f488822ff82da76e1","amp;dn":"Can+-+17+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f2a2614d39e2fd588d3844f488822ff82da76e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,42,38,20,211,158,47,213,136,211,132,79,72,136,34,255,130,218,118,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
