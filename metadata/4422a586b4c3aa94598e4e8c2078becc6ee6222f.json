Twelve years before the start of the series, the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox attacked the ninja village Konohagakure, slaughtering many people. In response, the leader of Konohagakure and its ninja military ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the Fourth Hokage ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ sacrificed his life to seal the demon inside Naruto when he was a newborn. Konohagakure, however, regarded Naruto as if he were the demon fox itself and mistreated him throughout most of his childhood. A decree made by the Third Hokage, who replaced the Fourth Hokage after his death, forbade anyone mention the attack of the demon fox to anyone. Years later, Naruto is tricked by the renegade ninja Mizuki into stealing a forbidden scroll, but is stopped by his teacher, Iruka Umino. When Iruka almost dies while protecting Naruto from Mizuki, Naruto defeats Mizuki using the power from the scroll, which develops the supernatural ability Jutsu Shadow Clone Technique that creates clones from himself. That encounter makes Naruto realize he was the container of the demon fox.\nNaruto: Shippuden (ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã…Â ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â«ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‹â€  ÃƒÂ§Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â¾ÃƒÂ©Ã‚Â¢Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¤Ã‚Â¼Ã‚ï¿½, Naruto ShippÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â«den?, lit. &quot;Naruto: Hurricane Chronicles&quot;) is the ongoing sequel to the original Naruto anime and covers the Naruto manga from volume twenty-eight on.\n\nSub-group: mixed till 91 dattebayo if i remember correctly after that mixed.\nFramerate: Mixed due to different sub-groups.\neng subs\n\n\nplease seed and don't let this one die it took quite some time to get everything in avi format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4422a586b4c3aa94598e4e8c2078becc6ee6222f","amp;dn":"naruto+shippuuden+1+-+141+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4422a586b4c3aa94598e4e8c2078becc6ee6222f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,34,165,134,180,195,170,148,89,142,78,140,32,120,190,204,110,230,34,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
