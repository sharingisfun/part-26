Welcome to Scion: No Safer Place. \n\nIt is the year 2059. Several major world cities are under the control of a security force called Scion. Paige Mahoney works in the criminal underworld of Scion London, part of a secret cell known as the Seven Seals. The work she does is unusual: scouting for information by breaking into othersÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â„¢ minds. Paige is a dreamwalker, a rare kind of clairvoyant, and in this world, the voyants commit treason simply by breathing. \n\nBut when Paige is captured and arrested, she encounters a power more sinister even than Scion. The voyant prison is a separate cityÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â€Oxford, erased from the map two centuries ago and now controlled by a powerful, otherworldly race. These creatures, the Rephaim, value the voyants highlyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â€as soldiers in their army. \n\nPaige is assigned to a Rephaite keeper, Warden, who will be in charge of her care and training. He is her master. Her natural enemy. But if she wants to regain her freedom, Paige will have to learn something of his mind and his own mysterious motives.\n\nThe Bone Season introduces a compelling heroineÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â€a young woman learning to harness her powers in a world where everything has been taken from her. It also introduces an extraordinary young writer, with huge ambition and a teeming imagination. Samantha Shannon has created a bold new reality in this riveting debut.
