It contains many Reason 4 or later files which can be used by any Reason musician to produce music. Songs are self contained. That is why it is called auto refill. Some songs therefore are around 28 MegaBytes.\r\n\r\nRNS files can be loaded straight into your Reason Sequencer. MP3 is just for people without Sequencer.\r\n\r\nBecause of legacy Yamaha XG Synthesizers are supported too.\r\n\r\nRelease 004 will be supported until April 1th 2016.\r\n\r\nThis is Release 006, it now includes to many additional songs to simply update from the website.\r\n\r\nIt has been verified to work on Propellerhead Reason 5 despite everything is created with Reason 4 ( and even Reason 2 )\r\n\r\nWhen downloading with a Torrent client you should copy files you want to use or change to another directory.
