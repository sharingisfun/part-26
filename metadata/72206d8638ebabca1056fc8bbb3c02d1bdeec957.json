As she starts to question her way of life, she encounters a group of fashion design students who have a clothing label known as &quot;Paradise Kiss&quot;. The group needs to find a model to showcase their designs in an up-coming fashion show and decides to pick Yukari. Initially, Yukari is reluctant to be associated with this seemingly eccentric group, but eventually she realises they are really nice people. Furthermore, their passion and enthusiasm to follow their ideals and dreams make Yukari realise that she has not been enjoying her life and thus motivates her to pursue her own dreams. The story follows Yukari as she gets involved in the group and eventually falls in love with the leader, George.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72206d8638ebabca1056fc8bbb3c02d1bdeec957","amp;dn":"Paradise+Kiss+Episodes+1+-+12+English+Dubbed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72206d8638ebabca1056fc8bbb3c02d1bdeec957","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,32,109,134,56,235,171,202,16,86,252,139,187,60,2,209,189,238,201,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
