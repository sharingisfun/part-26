You can also use it to find the best rocket motor combinations for your existing kits, and to teach yourself and others about the physics of rocket flight. More modelers, teachers, and engineers use RockSim than all the other rocketry programs combined! \n\nRockSim allows you to take your cool rocketry ideas, and flush out the concept to see if they'll be stable when you launch them. \n\nRockSim was the first software that combines both &quot;design&quot; and &quot;simulation&quot; into one seamless program. What that means is that you create a drawing of the rocket, and simply click a button to see how that design will perform. That makes it quick and easy to check the feasibility of your ideas.&quot;\n\nHere are some pictures of the actual program viewing a Saturn 5 rocket &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img175.imageshack.us/img175/488/rocksim1qp0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img175.imageshack.us/img175/488/rocksim1qp0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img151.imageshack.us/img151/9782/rocksim2df3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img151.imageshack.us/img151/9782/rocksim2df3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nPlease leave comments helpful to others and seed once finished  8) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3b6d598ffac957714a5c7f85ead1e4447d9c355","amp;dn":"RockSim+7.03+%28Rocket+Simulation+Software%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3b6d598ffac957714a5c7f85ead1e4447d9c355","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,182,213,152,255,172,149,119,20,165,199,248,94,173,30,68,71,217,195,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
