Since the first LP, the duo have relocated from the Lisbon underground to Glasgow's sympathetic scene and northern climes (also home of Night School Records) to re-assess their sound, which slots neatly within the city's famed tastes for future funk and art-wized fuzz. Their 'Greatest It's' sounds like it was made on half-asleep machines plugged into an unreliable power source, but still manages to tap into an essence of wayward human wit and spirit that the flashiest pro-tools production could never capture. We can detect a dancefloor yen at it's core, but one blunted by too much weed smoke and plumping for the couch instead, better to wander its crumbling beat loops and soak-up/decipher its emotional ambiguity. We've not got track titles to hand, but our favourite bits are best described by their shape and timbre, including a low-bitrate Badalamenti-esque vignette and lop-sided cut-up up of soured Sublime Frequencies vocal and industrial R&amp;B clank on the A-side, thru a portion of melting midnight jazz motifs and pensile sci-fi pads or the slopped and screwed synth wooze that closes the B-side. If you liked their last LP, it's a must, and if you're mourning the death of Hype Williams, it's the perfect consolation.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbccd6fc15ec757d5f974a7bfede8e2064c30a7d","amp;dn":"Yong+Yong+-+Greatest+It%27s+%282014%29+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbccd6fc15ec757d5f974a7bfede8e2064c30a7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,204,214,252,21,236,117,125,95,151,74,123,254,222,142,32,100,195,10,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
