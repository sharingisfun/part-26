It was released on December 18, 2009.\n\nThe music video premiered on Friday, November 13th, 2009 on German TV. It shows Furtado and her boyfriend in different situations. Scenes with Furtado singing in a room with a big mirror and an armchair are also featured. First, Furtado and her boyfriend are shown during breakfast. Furtado hands him the plate, but he does not look at her. Then he leaves and at night, when Furtado is already in bed, he comes home late and goes to bed, too, but he does not look at her again. Then they sit in the living-room; he is chatting on his laptop and when he leaves the room, she looks at it. She realizes that he betrays her. So she drives to the address and waits for her boyfriend and his affair to come out of the house. She gets out of the car and shouts at the two. She fights with her boyfriend and at the end of the video, she returns to her car, followed by her singing the last line of the song in front of the mirror.\n\n&quot;MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s&quot; deals with the dynamic of a problematic relationship, that slowly begins to fade. The singer wants to feel, live and be loved more (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s). Furtado describes it as a simple love song.\n\nMÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s was released as a download single on December 18, 2009 in Germany. The date of the release as CD single is still unknown.
