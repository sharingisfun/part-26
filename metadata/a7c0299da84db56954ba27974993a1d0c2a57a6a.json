And I thought that Ã¢â‚¬Å“Breaking BadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was supposed to end this weekend! While AMC was Ã¢â‚¬Å“Breaking Bad,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the GOP was Ã¢â‚¬Å“Breaking Worse.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ What the Republicans in Congress are doing is worse than cooking and dealing meth. Meth manufacturers only blow up the garageÃ¢â‚¬â€the Republicans are poised to blow up the entire economy.\n\nBill Clinton said that Republicans are Ã¢â‚¬Å“begging for America to fail.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Give them a little credit, Bill. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not begging for America to fail. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re out there taking very proactive steps to ensure that it fails.\n\nRepublican Peter King says that he will not vote for another measure to delay or defund Obamacare. After all, there are only so many times you can cast a vote to wreck the government and the economy before you just have to draw a line! It turns out that Peter KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problem isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so much with destroying the government as it is with who is leading the destroyers. That danged Ted Cruz even gives shutting down the government a bad name! Peter says Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m tired of having Ted Cruz call the shots for the House Republicans.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t we find a leader who wants to destroy this country and who isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t such a jerk?\n\nThis weekend Ted Cruz got grilled by David Gregory on Meet the Press. See Ted, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not so easy to get away with lies when somebody else is allowed to talk every 20 hours or so. As Dick Gregory told Ted Ã¢â‚¬Å“You havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t moved anyone.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hey, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to drag people into the bubble when you refuse to leave it.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s next? Lawmakers are digging in. Well, the Republicans in the House have been digging furiously for months. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in this hole. Now they have less than 12 hours to climb out, or drag the rest of us into it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7c0299da84db56954ba27974993a1d0c2a57a6a","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+September+30+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7c0299da84db56954ba27974993a1d0c2a57a6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,192,41,157,168,77,181,105,84,186,39,151,73,147,161,208,194,165,122,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
