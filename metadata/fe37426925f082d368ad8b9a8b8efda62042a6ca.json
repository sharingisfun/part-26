He's still hard country today, when it's even less fashionable. Darrell's best known as Faron Young's frontman during the early Sixties and as one of Ray Price's Cherokee Cowboys. He kept the Ray Price shuffle alive long after Price himself had abandoned it. These five CDs contain 143 songs, including everything that Darrell recorded between 1960 and 1981 for Starday, Capitol, Wayside, Philips, American Heritage, Columbia, RCA and other labels. It also includes some blues demos for the legendary Jimmy Reed as well as rare commercials and transcriptions. All of Darrell's hits are here, including 'Dear One', 'A Stranger Was Here', 'Dreams Of A Dreamer', and 'Lily Dale' with Willie Nelson. Country music comes no more honest or straightforward than this. Like the sign says on his mailbox: DARRELL, THE REAL McCALL.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe37426925f082d368ad8b9a8b8efda62042a6ca","amp;dn":"Darrell+McCall+-+The+Real+McCall++%5BBear+Family+5+disc+set%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe37426925f082d368ad8b9a8b8efda62042a6ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,55,66,105,37,240,130,211,104,173,139,154,139,142,253,166,32,66,166,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
