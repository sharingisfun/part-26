Featuring 14 new songs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPin Points and Gin JointsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has the band\nat their fun, exuberant, chaotic best. The rare band comfortable in\nalmost any genre they are also patient, passionate songwriters.\nBlending ska and soul, punk and metal, and arrow to the heart pop,\nthese songs are the Bosstones at their best. Lead singer and lyricist\nDicky Barrett is at the top of his game as a brash cynic, a harsh\ncritic and a crooner with a heart of gold. His voice as both a\nstoryteller and poet is highlighted in songs about family life,\npolitics, war, art, biker gangs, baseball, ska music legends and blue\ncollar stiffs. With Pin Points and Gin Joints the Bosstones have taken\ntheir trademark power chord, driving horns, wicked backbeat sound back\nto the barroom for another round of shots.\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a1d2c8d3c4e1c9d4d2c98fc0c8&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99a78e9b1de586a6141b2b3f6ca5db811f310621","amp;dn":"The_Mighty_Mighty_Bosstones-Pin_Points_And_Gin_Joints-2009-SiRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99a78e9b1de586a6141b2b3f6ca5db811f310621","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,167,142,155,29,229,134,166,20,27,43,63,108,165,219,129,31,49,6,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
