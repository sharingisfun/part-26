Strangely, virtually no time was dedicated to the music of the OxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own group, the John Entwistle Band. As the JEB was EntwistleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s primary creative outlet between sporadic Who reunion tours and all-star celebrity gigs, it seems fitting that the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 1999 Left For Live album has been re-released as a new deluxe edition, improving upon the original pressing by including a second disc of JEB concert tracks. The 24 songs were recorded in various venues over the course of 1998 and 1999 and offer an earful of Entwistle at his thunderous best. Amply backed by long time musical collaborator and drummer Steve Luongo, vocalist/guitarist Godfrey Townsend and keyboardist Gordon Cotten, Entwistle treats his audiences to some much loved Who classics and covers, in addition to a variety of outstanding individual/solo compositions. \n\nClocking in at over an hour, disc one begins with the intro ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBogeymanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ segueing quickly into standard JEB set starter ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHorror RockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The opening blast of these tracks should serve as a harbinger of things to come, as the next 11 songs serve up something for every discerning musical palette. There is the timeless signature song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Real MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ where EntwistleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trademark rumble is accented by TownsendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gritty vocals. Gone is the songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s glossy Quadrophenia studio polish and cavernous stadium sound, replaced instead by a remarkably crisp and powerful version only a small venue with a top flight mixing board could capture. Present also are the songs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy SizeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLove Is a Heart AttackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, from EntwistleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s earlier solo efforts; JEB penned selections ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSometimesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDarker Side of Night;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and several of EntwistleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s familiar Who album tunes, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTrick of the LightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSuccess StoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (which will forever be linked to the image of the Ox using gold albums for skeet practice in The Kids Are Alright film). \n\nSong breaks are punctuated by EntwistleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wry humor, discernable crowd chatter and clinking of glasses. This adds to the discÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s distinctive live setting feel as it brings the listener right into the small clubs that the JEB almost exclusively played in. Disc oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s final three tracks offer listeners an interesting aural surprise. Track 11 is a rare live version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCousin KevinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from the rock opera Tommy followed by a cover of Roger DaltreyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s solo hit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnder a Raging MoonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which features an extended Luongo drum solo described by Entwistle as being ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œas long as Winston 100 cigaretteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Track 13 is the first of EntwistleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s two most famous songs, a rollicking ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBoris the SpiderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, (the second being ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy WifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which were both surprisingly absent from the original Left for Live release). In addition to confirming the JEBÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s prowess as a live act, disc one also makes a noteworthy point. While EnwistleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bass is obviously the driving force within the band, it does not overshadow the rest of the group. Quite the opposite, it compliments the othersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ contributions. Interesting in that Entwistle was constantly battling against Pete TownshendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitar and Keith MoonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s drum kit throughout the WhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heyday. \n\nThe second disc opens with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ905ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, EntwistleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s amusing look at the future, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHad EnoughÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, both from the WhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Who Are You album. The latter is notable for TownsendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ragged vocal and CottonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s keyboard incorporating the perfect amount of angst to stay true to the original album version. Following are the somewhat autobiographical ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEndless VacationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and EntwistleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first written effort with the Who, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhiskey ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Next comes a brief downshift in momentum, the hauntingly attractive ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œToo Late the HeroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. While EntwistleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocals are a bit strained, (more attributable to his progressive hearing loss than any obvious voice problems), the song demonstrates his versatility as a songwriter, and is a reminder of the distant second place he was often relegated to behind Pete Townshend in the composition department. \n\nThe albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s energy level is ratcheted back up once again with two of three covers of Who cover tunes: Mose AllisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYoung Man BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Johnny KiddÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShakinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ All OverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The 15-plus-minutes of disc time taken up by the pair is as explosive as any quarter hour of live music ever recorded. Featuring fiery guitar work, sneering vocals, precision drumming and keyboards, all accentuated by EntwistleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s deafening bass roar, these versions are as close to the WhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Live At Leeds or Isle Of Wight as one will find. Hardcore aficionados will be proud. Equally powerful renditions of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeaven And HellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Eddie CochranÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSummertime BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ follow, (the latter being the third cover of the aforementioned three), culminating in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy WifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, fittingly performed (and noted by Entwistle) on the last night of the JEB tour. \n\nOn its own, Left For Live Deluxe is an amazingly strong live recording, and a necessity for every Who fanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s collection. More significantly though, the twin disc set is an enduring tribute to EntwistleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s immense talent as a musician, and the JEBÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s formidable live presence. It leaves a fitting legacy for those who loved the Ox, and provides an appropriate soundtrack for the memories cherished by the lucky ones who saw the JEB up close and personal. As the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s liner notes poignantly instruct listeners, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhen it thunders ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ think of John Entwistle.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nDISC 1: \n\n 1.
