Led by a team of experts, you will quickly understand the difference between computer science and computer programming, and you will learn how algorithms help you solve computing problems.\n\nEach chapter builds on material introduced earlier in the book, so you can master one core building block before moving on to the next. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll explore fundamental topics such as loops, arrays, objects, and classes, using the easy-to-learn Ruby programming language. Then you will put everything together in the last chapter by programming a simple game of tic-tac-toe.\n\nLearn how to write algorithms to solve real-world problems\nUnderstand the basics of computer architecture\nExamine the basic tools of a programming language\nExplore sequential, conditional, and loop programming structures\nUnderstand how the array data structure organizes storage\nUse searching techniques and comparison-based sorting algorithms\nLearn about objects, including how to build your own\nDiscover how objects can be created from other objects\nManipulate files and use their data in your software\n\nTable of Contents:\nChapter 1. Introduction to Computer Science\nChapter 2. How Does the Computer Really Work?\nChapter 3. Core Programming Elements\nChapter 4. Conditional Structures\nChapter 5. Loop Structures\nChapter 6.
