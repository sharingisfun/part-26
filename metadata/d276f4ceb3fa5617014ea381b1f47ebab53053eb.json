The other people in the internment camp, including Brainiac 5, Dream Girl and Chameleon Boy, have no recollection of who they are or their life before the camp. Using her telepathy, Saturn Girl learns that everyone has a mental block in their mind but her telepathic powers aided her in overcoming them on her own. She saves her fellow Legionnaires, using her mind powers to overcome their blocks, and devises a plan to get off the island and figure out what's going on. Meanwhile, Universo reveals he hypnotized the President of Earth as well as everyone on the planet. He was also behind the death of his son, Rond Vidar, a fact he claims was necessary in controlling the world.\n\nThanks goes to Tol EressÃƒÂ«a for this release.\n\nLegion of Super-Heroes v3 #1-30 + Annual #1-2: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9182882&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9182882&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLegion of Super-Heroes v3 #31: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9212358&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9212358&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
