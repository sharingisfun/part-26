Crossed Badlands #28: the final chapter in Garth Ennis' return to the grueling world of the Crossed in &quot;The Fatal Englishman&quot; storyline.\n\nEverything comes down to this. The pieces are in place and the soldiers are ready to end a lifetime of fighting by releasing the deadliest contagions ever contained and wiping the slate clean for England. No Crossed, no humans, no animalsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦just nature reclaimed from the monsters that inherited it. But when faced with the final decision will it be cut and dry? Or will the Crossed throw some horrible wrinkle into the plan that causes everyone to die writhing in agony?\n\nJoin Garth Ennis as he spins a Crossed tale for the ages. And remember that in a world of monsters, there is no help, there is no hope. There is only... the Crossed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65af0928e76dcb3ccbc1d21414497cd3ebfcb304","amp;dn":"CROSSED+-+BADLANDS+028+%282013%29+%284+Covers%29+%281920px%29+%28Darkness-Empi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65af0928e76dcb3ccbc1d21414497cd3ebfcb304","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,175,9,40,231,109,203,60,203,193,210,20,20,73,124,211,235,252,179,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
