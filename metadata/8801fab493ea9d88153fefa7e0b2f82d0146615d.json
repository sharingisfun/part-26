He uses red and orange (complimentary and opposite colors) to make some remarks.\n- In his book, &quot;What Just Happened?&quot;, producer Art Linson reveals that the narration in the movie was written by David Mamet. It was done for free, on the condition that nobody ever find out he did it.\n- Ca d&amp;#039; Zan, a mansion in Sarasota, Fl, stood for Ms. Dismoor mansion. It once belonged to circus magnate John Ringling and his wife Mable.\n- In addition to co-writing, performing and producing the song &quot;Siren&quot; especially for this film, Tori Amos provided the vocalizations (wistling, breaths, etc.) that can be heard in the film&amp;#039;s score.\n- While sharing the title with the 1861 Charles Dickens novel, it is only loosely based on it.\n\nReviews:\n\nA modernization of the classic tale done in great style!, 10 August 2004\n8/10 Author: Gillian Wixley from South Africa\n\nIt is always going to be a challenge to take a classic novel and turn it into be a movie that will satisfy everyone, especially when the story is being changed and adapted to fit a modern setting. If what you want to find from this movie is an exact translation of the book you will be unimpressed.\n\nI personally loved this movie, it is completely stylish thanks to a brilliant soundtrack and the gorgeous leads Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow (who is cast perfectly as the beautiful ice queen). They are helped along by a strong supporting cast of Anne Bancroft (wonderfully eccentric as Ms. Nora Dinsmoor), Chris Cooper and Robert DiNero.\n\nThe problem, however, is that in trying to fit a story as long and complicated as ÃƒÂ¢??Great expectations&amp;#039; into a 90 minute movie you loose a lot of the development of the characters necessary to identify and have an emotional reaction to them.\n\nRather than linger on these issues Alfonso Cuaron concentrated on the visual aspect of the movie and the result is a movie that is great to watch!\n----------------------------------------\n\n28 out of 36 people found the following comment useful :-\nJust what I expected., 29 March 1999\n9/10 Author: Rick Peach (&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;abc9cececdd8c6cac8c0ebdccec9dfdd85c5cedf&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;) from USA\n\nI went into Great Expectations with high hopes. The story has always been one of my favorites and I couldn&amp;#039;t wait too see what they had done with it. The film is beautiful. It is very rich in color and scope. The cinematography was outstanding and the direction was solid. The acting was brillant all around. Robert De Niro is in the movie only briefly, but brings respect to a role that could be just a flash in the pan for anyone else. Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow are great and Chris Cooper turns in a very subtle but powerful performance as Finn&amp;#039;s guardian. The film left me feeling good, what more could you ask for in a movie?\n----------------------------------------\n\n37 out of 55 people found the following comment useful :-\nThe Green World, 10 December 2000\n10/10 Author: vindana ariyawansa\n\nThis movie, an absolute winner in many ways, lacked the recognition it deserved heavily, the wonderful green theme that runs throughout the movie makes it very pleasant for the viewing eye. Great Cinematography, Great Cast, Great music, add up to deliver a Great Movie which fulfils the viewers Great Expectations.\n----------------------------------------\n\n17 out of 19 people found the following comment useful :-\na visual masterpiece, 2 June 1999\n8/10 Author: sickboy-11 from morristown, TN\n\nGreat Expectations is one of the few films that can incorporate stunning visuals, one of the best soundtracks to ever grace a film and simply characters that you truly care about by the end of the film.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s true that the character development on the character of Finn is a little weak, but the characters of Estella and the over flamboyant and heartbroken Miss Dinnsmore certainly make up for Finn&amp;#039;s minor flaws. Personally i found the film very enjoyable and immersive, and the incredibly imaginative cinematography will certainly keep anyone&amp;#039;s attention as well.\n\nThis film is a stylish and brilliant remake of a classic and could almost be considered timeless compared to other recent attempts at &quot;updating&quot; the classics which fail in comparison(such as the recent failed attempt at romeo and juliet). Great Expectations is certainly worth a rental (or even purchase) for anyone that enjoys simply a good, immersive movie with some absolutely beautiful imagery.\n----------------------------------------\n\n19 out of 25 people found the following comment useful :-\nA movie as itself, 14 May 1999\nAuthor: balthzar from Norman, OK\n\nToo many times we fall into the trap of comparing a movie with the book. Every director and every writer has a vision and we must judge that vision through their respective mediums. This film brings an unconventional theme to a society fascinated by what they cannot have. This film symbolizes just that. Standing on its own, this film was magnificent in its visual images and music and very many other areas. Do not be caught in that trap of comparing this film to the book. Dickens should never be compared to any screenwriter in the first place.\n----------------------------------------\n\n17 out of 22 people found the following comment useful :-\nA Beautiful Cinematic Painting, 5 March 1999\nAuthor: Miguel Cane (&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4d3e39283d2b223f290d342c252222632e2220&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;) from Mexico\n\nThe key here is Color, along with the Tori Amos songs, Gwyneth Paltrow&amp;#039;s beauty and Ethan Hawke&amp;#039;s charm. This is not a film to be seen lightly, probably purists will hate the story, but hey, who gives a damn when you have a beautiful picture to admire... and Anne Bancroft to boot?
