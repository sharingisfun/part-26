Although the tempo is slow and the strings provide a thick carpet of sound, there is nothing here that could possibly be described as 'schmaltzy'. And this means that both jazz fans and romantic hearts will enjoy and praise this disc.\nHappily, the technical state of the 1954 recording tapes in the Verve archive is excellent so that the listener can experience and enjoy to the full the relaxed atmosphere of Norman GranzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recording studio\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never heard any of these numbers, then you should place the needle on &quot;Do NothinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Till You Hear From Me&quot; or &quot;Sophisticated Lady&quot;. All other listeners will know that every single minute of this disc is pure magic!
