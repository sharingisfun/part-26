Garfunkel's pure, high tenor had been one of the most distinctive elements of the duo's music, yet he wasn't responsible for the songwriting -- Simon wrote all of the group's hits. Not surprisingly, Garfunkel relied on other songwriters, from Jimmy Webb and Randy Newman, in addition to rock &amp; roll standards like &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You,&quot; throughout his solo career. As a solo performer, he was never quite as successful as he was with Simon &amp; Garfunkel, yet he did have a number of Top 40 hits in the mid-'70s.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nOriginal Release Date:\t1975\n\nBreakaway is the second solo album by Art Garfunkel. It was released in 1975 on Columbia Records. It was produced by Richard Perry who has produced albums for other artists such as Carly Simon. It includes three Top 40 singles: &quot;I Only Have Eyes For You&quot; (US #18), &quot;Break Away&quot; (US #39) and the Simon And Garfunkel reunion duet, &quot;My Little Town&quot; which peaked at #9. &quot;I Only Have Eyes For You&quot; is noted also for being Garfunkel's first #1 single in the UK. Breakaway has proven to be Garfunkel's most successful solo album; although only peaking at number 9, which was lower than his first album Angel Clare (US #5), it has been certified platinum by RIAA.\n\n01.I Believe (When I Fall In Love It Will Be Forever)\n02.Rag Doll\n03.Break Away\n04.Disney Girls\n05.Waters Of March (Aguas De Marco)\n06.My Little Town\n07.I Only Have Eyes For You\n08.Lookin' For The Right One\n09.99 Miles From L.A.\n10.The Same Old Tears On A New Background\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33bd55d8fcf2b6b444652b00b4075844b401d843","amp;dn":"Art+Garfunkel+-+Breakaway+%281990%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33bd55d8fcf2b6b444652b00b4075844b401d843","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,189,85,216,252,242,182,180,68,101,43,0,180,7,88,68,180,1,216,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
