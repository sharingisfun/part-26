Traumatic first date. An obsessive first boyfriend she can't understand. \n\nIt's taken her years but she's finally able to leave her small town life behind for a new start as a freshmen at UW- Madison. For Jules this chance to be independent and rebuild her life is an opportunity she won't ever let anyone take from her again. She's determined to make something of herself without a man by her side, in front, behind or anywhere near her. \n\nReid &quot;Pax&quot; Paxton is the star quarterback for the UW Badgers. His brush with death makes him understand how precious life is, and how important it is to take life by the horns, unafraid. Jules knows he's dangerous for her. Dark hair. Smoldering eyes. Killer smile. That dimple. That body. Those arms. Pax is everything she's trying to run away from, but she can't help coming back for more. Slowly he begins to show a life together can be more than just a dream. It can be their reality. The truth about reality is it's not always sunshine and butterflies.\n\nSometimes it's a wasteland. \n\nSometimes secrets can't stay buried.\n\nSometimes your past will find a way to hunt you down.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d626f1b394cdcafc7612b27f229dacce3acf029f","amp;dn":"One+-+Arden%2C+Mari.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d626f1b394cdcafc7612b27f229dacce3acf029f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,38,241,179,148,205,202,252,118,18,178,127,34,157,172,206,58,207,2,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
