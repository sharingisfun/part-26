Growing up on basketball, he became close friends with some of basketball&amp;#039;s greatest players, including: Gary Payton, Jason Kidd, Brian Shaw, J.R Rider, Greg Foster and Antonio Davis, and they all exclaim that he was better than they were. The story of how &quot;Hook&quot; wound up incarcerated is told in this poignant tale of a life gone wrong by his NBA friends, his family and Hook himself. &quot;Hook&quot; Mitchell is considered one of the greatest basketball player to never make it to the NBA.
