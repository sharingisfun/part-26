It features most of their singles plus album tracks including &quot;Breaking into Heaven&quot; and &quot;This is the One&quot;, all of which were remastered for this album. It charted at #19 in the UK and spent nine weeks in the Top 75.\nSilvertone has been derided for supposedly cashing in on their famous signing. However, The Very Best of is a fairly comprehensive compilation in that it gathers all the Stone Roses' best known tracks in the versions that are generally regarded as best. The tracklisting was decided upon by band members. The previous compilation The Complete Stone Roses had been criticised for not including material from the group's second album, whilst including inferior edits and alternative versions of many songs.\nNot only does the compilation contain six songs from their 1989 debut but the album is structured to open and close with the same songs in their album versions.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] I Wanna Be Adored  \n[02] She Bangs the Drums  \n[03] Ten Storey Love Song  \n[04] Waterfall  \n[05] Made of Stone  \n[06] Love Spreads  \n[07] What the World Is Waiting For  \n[08] Sally Cinnamon  \n[09] Fools Gold  \n[10] Begging You  \n[11] Elephant Stone  \n[12] Breaking into Heaven  \n[13] One Love  \n[14] This Is the One  \n[15] I Am the Resurrection  \n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:18m:29s\nTotal Folder File Size\t- 197mb (Including mp3, Art Covers &amp; Booklet, word doc)\nTotal Mp3 Bit Rate \t- 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v7.5.0.20 Mp3 Format\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\nMusic Genre\t\t- Rock\nOriginal CD Ripper \t- only1joe\nOriginal CD Uploader\t- only1joe\nOriginally Released\t- 04 November 2002\nRecords Company    \t- Silvertone Records BMG\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.thestoneroses.co.uk \n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\nAny Errors In Torrents Or Music Files ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Leave A Comment On My Most Recent Torrent.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83ba96790d5ba33ebceae47a8d79793cb64e92a1","amp;dn":"%5B2002%5D+The+Very+Best+Of+-+The+Stone+Roses+-+197mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83ba96790d5ba33ebceae47a8d79793cb64e92a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,186,150,121,13,91,163,62,188,234,228,122,141,121,121,60,182,78,146,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
