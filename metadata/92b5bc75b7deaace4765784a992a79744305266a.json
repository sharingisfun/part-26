With a science fiction and horror style, it gives the players the role of marines who find themselves in the focal point of an invasion from hell. The game introduced deathmatch and cooperative play in the explicit sense, and helped further the practice of allowing and encouraging fan-made modifications of commercial video games. First released as shareware in 1993 with 3 episodes: &quot;Knee-Deep in the Dead&quot;, &quot;The Shores of Hell &quot;, and &quot;Inferno&quot; and later as an expanded retail version called &quot;Ultimate Doom&quot; in 1995 with a fourth episode &quot;Thy Flesh Consumed&quot;. Ultimate Doom is the version included here.\n\nUses Chocolate-Doom to play.
