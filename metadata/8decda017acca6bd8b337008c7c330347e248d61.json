Nearly 4000 terms are defined, covering medical, survey, theoretical, and applied statistics, including computational and graphical aspects. Entries are provided for standard and specialized statistical software. In addition, short biographies of over 100 important statisticians are given. Definitions provide enough mathematical detail to clarify concepts and give standard formula when these are helpful. The majority of definitions then give a reference to a book or article where the user can seek further or more specialized information, and many are accompanied by graphical material to aid understanding.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8decda017acca6bd8b337008c7c330347e248d61","amp;dn":"The+Cambridge+Dictionary+of+Statistics+4th+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8decda017acca6bd8b337008c7c330347e248d61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,236,218,1,122,204,166,189,139,51,112,8,199,195,48,52,126,36,141,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
