Enjoy!\n\nAdditional information:\nThe Mortal Instruments is a series of six young adult fantasy novels written by Cassandra Clare, of which five have been published so far. The Mortal Instruments is chronologically the second series of a proposed five in The Shadowhunter Chronicles.\n\n1 City of Bones\n2 City of Ashes\n3 City of Glass\n4 City of Fallen Angels\n5 City of Lost Souls\n6 City of Heavenly Fire\n\nSummary for each of these\n1 Mortal Instruments:City of Bones\nWhen sixteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing Ã¢â‚¬â€¢not even a smear of bloodÃ¢â‚¬â€¢ to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?\n\nThis is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know... \n\n2 City of Ashes\nClary Fray just wishes that her life would go back to normal. But what's normal when you're a demon-slaying Shadowhunter, your mother is in a magically induced coma, and you can suddenly see Downworlders like werewolves, vampires, and faeries? If Clary left the world of the Shadowhunters behind, it would mean more time with her best friend, Simon, who's becoming more than a friend. But the Shadowhunting world isn't ready to let her go Ã¢â‚¬â€ especially her handsome, infuriating, newfound brother, Jace. And Clary's only chance to help her mother is to track down rogue Shadowhunter Valentine, who is probably insane, certainly evil Ã¢â‚¬â€ and also her father.\n\nTo complicate matters, someone in New York City is murdering Downworlder children. Is Valentine behind the killings Ã¢â‚¬â€ and if he is, what is he trying to do? When the second of the Mortal Instruments, the Soul-Sword, is stolen, the terrifying Inquisitor arrives to investigate and zooms right in on Jace. How can Clary stop Valentine if Jace is willing to betray everything he believes in to help their father?\n\n3 City of Glass\nTo save her mother's life, Clary must travel to the City of Glass, the ancestral home of the Shadowhunters - never mind that entering the city without permission is against the Law, and breaking the Law could mean death. To make things worse, she learns that Jace does not want her there, and Simon has been thrown in prison by the Shadowhunters, who are deeply suspicious of a vampire who can withstand sunlight.\n\nAs Clary uncovers more about her family's past, she finds an ally in mysterious Shadowhunter Sebastian. With Valentine mustering the full force of his power to destroy all Shadowhunters forever, their only chance to defeat him is to fight alongside their eternal enemies. But can Downworlders and Shadowhunters put aside their hatred to work together? While Jace realizes exactly how much he's willing to risk for Clary, can she harness her newfound powers to help save the Glass City - whatever the cost?\n\n4 City of Fallen Angels\nClary is back in New York and life is good: sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in training to be a shadowhunter and is finally able to call Jace her boyfriend. But nothing comes without a price. When Jace inexplicably begins to pull away from her, Clary is forced to acknowledge that she herself has set in motion a chain if events that could lead to the loss of everything she loves. Even Jace.\n\n5 City of Lost Souls\nWhat price is too high to pay, even for love? When Jace and Clary meet again, Clary is horrified to discover that the demon LilithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magic has bound her beloved Jace together with her evil brother Sebastian, and that Jace has become a servant of evil. The Clave is out to destroy Sebastian, but there is no way to harm one boy without destroying the other. As Alec, Magnus, Simon, and Isabelle wheedle and bargain with Seelies, demons, and the merciless Iron Sisters to try to save Jace, Clary plays a dangerous game of her own. The price of losing is not just her own life, but JaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soul. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willing to do anything for Jace, but can she still trust him? Or is he truly lost?\n\n\n6 City of Heavenly Fire\nDarkness returns to the Shadowhunter world. As their society falls apart around them, Clary, Jace, Simon and their friends must band together to fight the greatest evil the Nephilim have ever faced: ClaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own brother. Nothing in the world can defeat him Ã¢â‚¬â€ must they journey to another world to find the chance? Lives will be lost, love sacrificed, and the whole world changed in the sixth and last installment of the Mortal Instruments series!\n\n\nThank you for downloading!\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f9b094ebe2fa90f7ea5ca1d23000043c90fc402","amp;dn":"Mortal+Instruments+1-5+%28PDF+Collection+in+RAR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f9b094ebe2fa90f7ea5ca1d23000043c90fc402","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,155,9,78,190,47,169,15,126,165,202,29,35,0,0,67,201,15,196,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
