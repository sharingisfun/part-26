Every added shot has been colour-corrected and cleaned, and the film's soundtrack has been completely remastered and reworked. This is a brand new edit done in 2009, not the low-quality 2004 edit previously available. I started from scratch in order to deliver a high quality, coherent and longer edit of the film, finally including some never-before-used footage, making this the ultimate Nightmare edit, completed by a second DVD of bonus materials [cf. details below]. The DVDs include animated menus and chapters.\n\nDVD 2 : BONUS MATERIALS\n3,8Gb / NTSC / 16:9 and 4:3 / 720x480 / 6-pass VBR\nDD AC3 2.0 Stereo 224 and 448kbps English\nRun time: 155 mn\n\nA NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET : THE BEGINNING\nAn original fan edit of the &quot;Freddy's Nightmare&quot; pilot episode directed by Tobe Hooper, &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot;.
