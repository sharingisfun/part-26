An irreverent and fun magazine-style series looking at how science shapes the world around us. A team of experts grapple with hands-on experiments; relating to everything from amateur space travel to artificial life. From exploring the world s most advanced technological breakthroughs to learning how we can test and manipulate science in our own backyard, this series will put scientific theory to the test.\nFlight engineer Jem, biochemist Liz, science-mad Dallas and roving reporter Dr Yan take part in big stunts and team challenges, and get a glimpse of the technology of the future. With a PhD, a collection of science degrees and an enduring passion for all things scientific, the four presenters are the perfect group to bring cutting edge science to your screen.\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nEngineer Jem tries to smash a land speed record with the help of a single fire extinguisher, a go kart and a well oiled spanner. In an experiment that you really shouldn't try at home, Jem builds himself a go-kart attached to a staggeringly powerful fire extinguisher that uses the laws of physics to fire him along a race track and into the record books. With oil prices rising every year, Dallas takes on an issue that concerns all of us. What will we do when the oil runs out? At the moment, across the globe, we use 85 million barrels of crude oil every single day but the fact is that our oil supplies can't last forever. With Richard Branson as one of his guides, Dallas looks at the future of oil explorations, and tells us what this means for our wallets. Liz goes behind the scenes of the real CSI (the Forensic Science Service) to meet the scientists working with the police to solve real crimes. With one crime, three suspects and no DNA evidence, Liz launches her very own forensic investigation to catch the bad guy.\n\n2)  Part 2 \nLiz Bonnin, Dallas Campbell and Jem Stansfield take on more scientific challenges. Engineer Jem becomes a crash test dummy to discover how much g-force his body can take, while scientist Liz gets the Olympic treatment for Sport Relief. Dallas enters the weird world of the atom, and roving reporter Dr Yan Wong dives into a shark tank to explain why there are no long snorkels.\n\n3)  Part 3 \nDallas takes on the latest lie detection technology, while Liz looks at the dilemma that threatened to undermine her hero Charles Darwin. Jem faces his toughest challenge yet, to build a human-powered hydrofoil and Dr Yan gets on the 3D bandwagon.\n\n4)  Part 4 \nLiz Bonnin, Dallas Campbell, Jem Stansfield and Dr Yan Wong take on more experiments and scientific challenges. Jem hits the furnace to make steel and discovers how it built the modern world, while Liz investigates whether science can help humans live forever. Dallas turns into a dolphin with the help of the latest US technology, and Yan challenges museum visitors to make fire out of thin air.\n\n5)  Part 5 \nBang goes the Theory puts science to the test once more. The team start by looking at the science behind the recent volcanic ash crisis that has grounded Europe's planes. In the rest of the programme, Jem Stansfield visits a power station to explain why steam is still powering the country, while Dallas hits the slopes to discover the science behind skiing.\n\n6)  Part 6 \nDallas hits the streets to discover what makes people happy, while Liz travels to Norway to investigate the latest technology to combat climate change. Jem puts himself in harm's way in avalanche country, and Dr Yan sets an optical illusion challenge to a WI meeting.\n\n7)  Part 7 \nJem straps a race horse to his car to explain what horsepower is, Liz sets Dallas a free diving challenge that leaves him gasping for air, Dr Yan shows shoppers how to burn steel, and Dallas goes to CERN to see how a cosmic tea party created everything in the universe.\n\n8)  Part 8 \nIn the final episode of the series which puts science to the test, Liz looks at how smell works and launches a huge experiment into the nation's sense of smell. Dallas investigates new evidence that the origins of life on earth might have begun in space, while Dr Yan is handing out free wine to the shoppers of Rugby. And on the 25th anniversary of Back to the Future, Jem attempts to build a car that is fuelled by junk.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/4290/d0bo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/4290/d0bo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6564/8t8a.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6564/8t8a.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/5254/mv0x.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/5254/mv0x.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/300/i4vq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/300/i4vq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/6527/c063.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/6527/c063.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/4167/8xn3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/4167/8xn3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/9345/b5qr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/9345/b5qr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/5079/9efb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/5079/9efb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/3563/uija.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/3563/uija.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/705/5m9f.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/705/5m9f.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/1496/bzwd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/1496/bzwd.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/6653/s54d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/6653/s54d.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b1fcd0d8dff1fd829f81&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1528 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 30mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: average 327 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang_Goes_the_Theory&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang_Goes_the_Theory&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Bang%20Goes%20the%20Theory%3A%20Series%201&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Bang%20Goes%20the%20Theory%3A%20Series%201&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36590397091e7812cd9a8a977afad74eaf97481f","amp;dn":"BBC+Bang+Goes+The+Theory+Series+2+3of8+DVDRip+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36590397091e7812cd9a8a977afad74eaf97481f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,89,3,151,9,30,120,18,205,154,138,151,122,250,215,78,175,151,72,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
