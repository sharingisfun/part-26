J. C. Catford. The 2nd edition.\r\n\r\nThe best book to study phonetics.\r\nThe best book to investigate your own vocal tract.\r\nThe best book to develop motor sensation.\r\nThe best book to acquire new pronunciation.\r\n\r\nThis book is hard for those whose first language is not English,\r\nbecause target readers are from English speaking countries.\r\nSome of the exercises are very difficult for non-English native speakers,\r\nwhereas the same exercises are easy for English natives. \r\nBut the book is worth to face it.\r\n\r\nIf you are a learner of English, you will find real precise instructions\r\nhow to produce English sounds, though this book wasn't designed for that. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it's a scanned PDF.
