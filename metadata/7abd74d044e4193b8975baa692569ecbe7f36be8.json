The label comments:\n\n&quot;The banner Axemaster still might be familiar to many genre-lovers. In 1987 ('Blessing In The Skies,' Azra Records) and 1990 ('Death Before Dishonor'), the power metal group from Ohio has released two very underrated, cult albums.\n\n&quot;After 25 years, the guys are back with 'Overture To Madness;' released through Pure Steel Records. Old trademarks, known from the band for decades, also will be presented.\n Nevertheless, the band has arrived in the brave new world, but they still deliver their old passion without any compromises.\n On all twelve tracks partly aggressive, classical metal is joining forces with a modern, bright, but also authentic production.\n Some thrash influences and the rough, deeper vocals of the new, talented front man Geoff McGraw also fit perfect to the whole concept.&quot;\nType:\n    Full-length\nRelease date:\n    March 6th, 2015\nCatalog ID:\n    PSRCD105\n\nLabel:\n    Pure Steel Records\nFormat:\n    CD\nReviews:\n    None yet \n\n    Songs\n    Lineup\n    \n\n1. \tEntering Madness \t\t \n2. \tSanity's Requiem \t\t \n3. \tForsaken \t\t \n4. \tDream or Nightmare \t\t \n5. \tThirty Pieces of Silver \t\t \n6. \tCrimson Haze \t\t \n7. \tPeeling Skin \t\t \n8. \tSinister \t\t \n9. \tStatute of Liberty \t\t \n10. \tAshes \t\t \n11. \tChylde \t\t \n12. \tDark Souls \t\t \n13. \tEpic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7abd74d044e4193b8975baa692569ecbe7f36be8","amp;dn":"Axemaster+-+Overture+to+Madness+2015+ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7abd74d044e4193b8975baa692569ecbe7f36be8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,189,116,208,68,228,25,59,137,117,186,166,146,86,158,203,231,243,107,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
