Shorter is as comfortable bending rhythm,\nharmony and texture as the rest of the group, and along with Hancock, Carter and\nWilliams, he drives Miles further into outward-reaching territory.\n\nWith a firmer footing in the tradition than Rivers, and a more cerebral approach that\nmirrors Hancock's more intellectual tendencies, Shorter fits in as the perfect\ncomplement to Miles' ever more expansive reach. It would be another year before\nthe quintet would release E.S.P. , the first album of new compositions to grace a\nMiles Davis record since '61's Someday My Prince Will Come. While the group\nwould continue, for the most part, to mine the existing songbook for some time to\ncome, there is no question, by this stage, that something significant was going on.\nAnd by the time December '65 and the Plugged Nickel recordings arrived, it would\nbe even more evident that this quintet of young players would take music places it\nhad never been&quot;\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nMiles Davis (trumpet), Ron Carter (bass), George Coleman (tenor saxophone on\ndiscs 1-5), Victor Feldman (piano on disc 1), Frank Butler (drums on disc 1), Herbie\nHancock (piano on discs 2-7), Tony Williams (drums on discs 2-7), Sam Rivers\n(tenor saxophone on disc 6), Wayne Shorter (tenor saxophone on disc 7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
