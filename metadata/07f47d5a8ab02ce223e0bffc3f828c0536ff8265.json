Originally considered a &quot;lost generation,&quot; the 1970s are increasingly recognized as a crucial turning point in American filmmaking, and many films from the era have resurfaced from oblivion to become a reference for new directorial talents. The Last Great American Picture Show explores this pivotal era in American film history with a collection of essays by scholars and writers that firmly situates the decade as the time of the emergence of &quot;New Hollywood.&quot;\n\nSam Peckinpah, Arthur Penn, Peter Bogdanovich, Monte Hellman, Bob Rafelson, Hal Ashy, Robert Altman, and James Tobac: these legendary directors developed innovative techniques, gritty aesthetics, and a modern sensibility in American film. Here, contributors compellingly argue that the cinema of today's major directorsÃ¢â‚¬â€Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Quentin Tarantino, Ridley Scott, Robert ZemeckisÃ¢â‚¬â€could not have come into existence without the groundbreaking works produced by the directors of the 1970s. A wholly engaging and long-overdue investigation of this important era in American film, The Last Great American Picture Show reveals how the films of the 1970s transformed the American social consciousness and influenced filmmaking worldwide.\n\nPublisher: Amsterdam University Press; 1 edition (March 30, 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9053566317\nISBN-13: 978-9053566312","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07f47d5a8ab02ce223e0bffc3f828c0536ff8265","amp;dn":"The+Last+Great+American+Picture+Show+New+Hollywood+Cinema+in+the","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07f47d5a8ab02ce223e0bffc3f828c0536ff8265","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,244,125,90,138,176,44,226,35,224,191,252,63,130,140,5,54,255,130,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
