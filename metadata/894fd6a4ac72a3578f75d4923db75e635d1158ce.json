With photos, lists and breakout boxes, and full of Davis's trademark wry wit, Choke! will have sports lovers laughing so hard they'll, um, choke.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:894fd6a4ac72a3578f75d4923db75e635d1158ce","amp;dn":"Choke%21++Sporting+flops%2C+fiascos+and+brain+explosions+-+Tony+Davi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"894fd6a4ac72a3578f75d4923db75e635d1158ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,79,214,164,172,114,163,87,143,117,212,146,61,183,94,99,93,17,88,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
