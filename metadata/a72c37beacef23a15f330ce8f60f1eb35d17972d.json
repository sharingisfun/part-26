Its bizarre cover strangely resembles an Egyptian sarcophagus - but it is in fact Entwistle wearing a death mask while looking through the chest X-ray of a lung cancer patient, a parody of anti-smoking advertisments of the era.\n\nThe album itself offers a more downbeat and aggressive view of life than even the Who had to offer at their most pessimistic, as witnessed in the title track (aka &quot;My Size&quot;), and the closing track, &quot;I Believe In Everything&quot;, which ends with a seemingly impromptu chorus of &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, to end a sometimes uncompromising album on an unexpectedly happy note. The album also features a remake of Entwistle's Who classic &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; with Who roadie Cyrano Langston providing some acid-drenched guitar. Who bandmate Pete Townshend once said about the album, &quot;We learned more about John from him making an album than we did in all the years he'd ever played bass with us&quot;, a reference to both his quiet demeanor and his then-mostly unknown capabilities as a songwriter.\n\nKeith Moon, Vivian Stanshall and Neil Innes all make guest appearances.\n\n\nTrack listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. &quot;My Size&quot; \n02. &quot;Pick Me Up (Big Chicken)&quot; \n03. &quot;What Are We Doing Here?&quot; \n04. &quot;What Kind of People Are They?&quot; \n05. &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; \n06. &quot;Ted End&quot; \n07. &quot;You're Mine&quot; \n08. &quot;No. 29 (Eternal Youth)&quot; \n09. &quot;I Believe in Everything&quot; \n10. &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot;\n11. &quot;What Are We Doing Here? [Alternate Version]&quot; \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJohn Alec Entwistle (9 October 1944 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 27 June 2002) was an English bass guitarist, songwriter, singer, and horn player, who was best known as the bass guitarist for the rock band The Who. His aggressive lead sound influenced rock bass players[1][2] such as Steve Harris, Geddy Lee, Phil Lesh, Billy Sheehan, Lemmy Kilmister and Chris Squire.\n\nEntwistle's lead instrument approach used pentatonic lead lines, and a then-unusual trebly sound created by roundwound RotoSound steel bass strings. He had a collection of over 200 instruments by the time of his death, reflecting the different brands he used over his career: Fender and Rickenbacker basses in the 1960s, Alembic's basses in the 1970s, Warwick in the 1980s, and Status all-graphite basses in the 1990s.\n\n\nEntwistle's technique ranged from using fingers, plectra and tapping to utilizing harmonics in his passages. He would change the style of play between songs and even during songs to change the sound he produced. His fingering technique would involve pressing down on the string hard and releasing in an attempt to reproduce a trebly, twangy sound. Note however, that he would change his thumb position from pickup, to the E string and occasionally even allowing his thumb to float near the pickup. His plectrum technique would involve holding the plectrum between his thumb and forefinger, with the rest of his fingers outstretched for balance.\n\nEntwistle's playing style was rarely captured well in the studio. He was better heard in concert, where he and guitarist Pete Townshend frequently exchanged roles, with Entwistle providing rapid melodic lines and Townshend anchoring the song with rhythmic chord work. Indeed, Townshend noted that Entwistle did the rhythmic timekeeping in the band, doing the role of the drummer. Moon, on the other hand, with all his flourishes around the kit, was like a keyboard player. In 1989, Entwistle pointed out that, according to modern standards, &quot;The Who haven't a proper bass player.&quot;[3] Entwistle turned the treble all the way up on his bass amps, and rarely turned the bass up, if not even using it at all. Starting from around 1989, right up to his death, Entwistle started adding his amps' onboard overdrive to his bass playing.\n\nEntwistle also developed what he called a &quot;typewriter&quot; approach to playing the bass. It involved positioning the right hand over the strings so all four fingers could be used to tap percussively on the strings, causing them to strike the fretboard with a distinctive twangy sound. This gives the player the ability to play three or four strings at once, or to use several fingers on a single string. It allowed him to create passages that were very percussive and melodic. He used this approach to mimic the fills used by his drummers in band situations, sometimes sending the fills back at the drummers faster than the drummers themselves could play them.\n\nThis method is unique and should not be confused with the hammer-on tapping techniques of Eddie Van Halen and Stu Hamm or the slapping technique of Larry Graham, and in fact pre-dates these other techniques. A demonstration of this approach to bass playing can be seen on a video called John Entwistle - Master Class, part of Arlen Roth's Hot Licks instructional series, as well as Mike Gordon's film, Rising Low. Demonstrated in Mike Gordon's film, Rising Low is John's tendency to use his fore, middle and ring fingers on his right hand when playing. This would allow him to create &quot;clusters of notes&quot; in his bass lines, as well as play triplets with relative simplicity. Notable in his left-handed technique is his use of slides, positioning the left hand for octaves and his use of the pentatonic scale.\n\nEntwistle identified his influences as a combination of his school training on French horn, trumpet, and piano (giving his fingers strength and dexterity). Musicians who influenced him included rock &amp; roll guitarists Duane Eddy and Gene Vincent, and American soul and R&amp;B bassists such as James Jamerson. Like Jamerson, Entwistle is credited as a pioneer on the bass guitar. In turn, Entwistle has been a massive influence on the playing styles and sounds used by generations of bass players that have followed him and continues to top 'best ever bass player' polls in musicians magazines. In 2000, Guitar magazine named him &quot;Bassist of the Millennium&quot; in a readers' poll.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a72c37beacef23a15f330ce8f60f1eb35d17972d","amp;dn":"John+Entwistle+-+%5C%27Smash+Your+Head+Against+The+Wall%5C%27+%5B320k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a72c37beacef23a15f330ce8f60f1eb35d17972d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,44,55,190,172,239,35,161,95,51,12,232,246,15,30,179,93,23,151,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
