SAMBA MAPANGALA took his skills as a musician from Zaire to East Africa in the 70's and finally settled in Kenya, where he became a big hit. These tracks were developed and recorded by his group ORCHESTRE VIRUNGA in the early 80's, and all hum with creative energy. Complementing the rich vocals of SAMBA and FATAKI are some sublime guitar licks from various master guitarists and a bubbling bass. Check out LAWI SOMANA'S solo on AHMED SABIT, which teases the senses so exquisitely, and helps make this track a classic. Another noticeable feature of the album is the jazzy horn section. \n\nA1 \t  \tMalako \t        9:03 \t\nA2 \t  \tAhmed Sabit \t9:21 \t\nB1 \t  \tVirunga \t8:55 \t\nB2 \t  \tYembele \t10:08 \t\n\nA later CD release added 2 bonus tracks, this is from an original 1st press of the 1990 Earthwork UK release.\n\nNeedledrop using:\n\nLinn LP12, Lingo, Ekos and Dynavector XX2 moving coil cartridge, Via  Naim 62 pre-amp into Pioneer PDR-609 CDR, using TDK audio CDR.\n\nArt work, from lp, included.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f57d7b22c9b86fe6b0bde141d2db088700cbc0c","amp;dn":"Sam+Mapangala+%26+Orchestre+Virunga+Virunga+Volcano","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f57d7b22c9b86fe6b0bde141d2db088700cbc0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,87,215,178,44,155,134,254,107,11,222,20,29,45,176,136,112,12,188,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
