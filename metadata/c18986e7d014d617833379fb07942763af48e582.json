Eventually, she did.\n\nHe felt like the kind of man who didn't just break the rules, but made new ones. He led and it was follow or get out of the way.\n\nWhy did a billionaire with a voice like liquid silk and a face like a bad angel take a second look at a girl in no-name jeans, with a fifteen-dollar haircut and a beat up car she calls her &quot;Eep&quot; because the 'J' fell off long ago?\n\nI didn't want to know why and when I thought I knew I didn't want to admit it. By the time I found his secret, it was already too late. His passion had me hooked like a drug. It didn't hurt that he pulled the people I love the most out of harm's way. A girl can get used to a knight in shining armor even when the armor has some very large dents in it.\n\nThis 33,000 word novella is part of a series, although this book can be enjoyed as stand alone work. This is adult fiction with explicit sexual content and is intended for mature readers only.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c18986e7d014d617833379fb07942763af48e582","amp;dn":"K.C.+Falls+-+Year+of+the+Billionaire+series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c18986e7d014d617833379fb07942763af48e582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,137,134,231,208,20,214,23,131,51,121,251,7,148,39,99,175,72,229,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
