While some might find the book too short, lacking in detail, or difficult to read because of the 1930's writing, I found the book enrapturing, well-researched, interesting, and a quick, enthralling read. The author knew his facts nearly impeccably, and he wrote a very informative story. For anyone interested in the life of Abraham Lincoln, this will provide you with an excellent sketch of most of the main details of his life, in a easy-to-read manner.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5087e97613b592278047ed4f2f4d4609bdd2fdf","amp;dn":"Lincoln+the+Unknown+by+Dale+Carnegie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5087e97613b592278047ed4f2f4d4609bdd2fdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,8,126,151,97,59,89,34,120,4,126,212,242,244,212,96,155,221,47,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
