Invincible! ShadowHawk! Zephyr! Four super powered teenagers from dysfunctional families band together to discover the heroes within. Every issue of this miniseries is self-contained, and each is written by one of the main character's creator: #1 by JIM VALENTINO (SHADOWHAWK), #2 by JAY FAERBER (NOBLE CAUSES), #3 by PHIL HESTER (FIREBREATHER) and #4 by INVINCIBLE's ROBERT KIRKMAN! THIS ISSUE: &quot;FATHER'S DAY&quot;?Belloc, Firebreather's father, comes to town, and all hell breaks loose when INVINCIBLE, SHADOWHAWK and ZEPHYR (from NOBLE CAUSES) try to help FIREBREATHER! But are these four even powerful enough to stop a gigantic fire-breathing dragon on a rampage? (If they're not, this is going to be a really short miniseries.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25760bbbeed735db87f199c367ace4f2608706ee","amp;dn":"The+Pact+%28v1+%26amp%3B+v2%29+%281994+%2B+2005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25760bbbeed735db87f199c367ace4f2608706ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,118,11,187,238,215,53,219,135,241,153,195,103,172,228,242,96,135,6,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
