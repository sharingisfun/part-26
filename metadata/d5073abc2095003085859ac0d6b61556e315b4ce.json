Sure, The Rocket Summer have pretty much cornered the genre, but they're a bit chirpier and happier. The Morning Of, however, manage to fill the void the two bands have left. Comprising the duel vocals of Jessica Leplon and Justin Wiley and produced by Jim Wirt (No Doubt, Something Corporate, The Rocket Summer), this record is 12 tracks of piano-led goodness. The dual vocals set the band apart from many others who have tried (and failed) to live up to the standards set by other bands, meaning the likes of 'What You Can't Control' are passionate, melodic rock songs that will have you shouting and singing along in no time.\n\nWhile the band don't stray from the formula all that much on 'The Way I Fell In', it works brilliantly throughout. There are bouncy poppy songs all over the shop, but the vocals trading blows off one another give this, at times, a slight feeling of melancholy.\n\nFormat: CD\nReleased 2010\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Pop\nQuality: 320kbps mp3\nAbsolute Punk rating: 90%\n\nTracks:\n\n1. \tJennasea   \t                3:20\n2. \tWhat You Can't Control   \t3:00\n3. \tThe Ones That Fall Apart   \t3:36\n4. \tTell Me I'm Wrong   \t        3:36\n5. \tDance with Me   \t        3:01\n6. \tCobwebs and Cables   \t        3:33\n7. \tThe Time It Takes to Grow   \t3:57\n8. \tLike Yesterday   \t        3:32\n9. \tI Know You Know   \t        3:52\n10. \tWaiting   \t                2:46\n11. \tBring Me Home   \t        3:00\n12. \tHeaven or Hell   \t        5:18","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5073abc2095003085859ac0d6b61556e315b4ce","amp;dn":"The+Morning+Of+-+The+Way+I+Fell+In+%282010%29+%5Bmp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5073abc2095003085859ac0d6b61556e315b4ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,7,58,188,32,149,0,48,133,133,154,192,214,182,21,86,227,21,180,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
