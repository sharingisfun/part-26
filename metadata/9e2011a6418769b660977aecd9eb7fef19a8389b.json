MankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopes for world peace lie battered and broken. Take command of SternÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wildcats, an elite squadron of mercs trying to fly straight in a world of deceit and violence. Engage rival merc squadrons, third world dictators, and the armies of the dreaded IRS. In a world gone mad, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty of room to fly, all thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s required is the cash.\n\nStrike Commander puts you in the best place to witness fast-paced dogfighting action: the pilotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seat. Fly high as you take on over 60 missions, each more challenging than the last in your top-of the-line F16 squadron piloted by the best crew in the business (operational success rate of 86%). Strike Commander is a classic flight combat sim where a pilot is only as good as his, or her, last flight. Fly to survive and survive to fly, in this modern-day action-oriented jet fighter combat simulation!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/gamecard/strike_commander&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/gamecard/strike_commander&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e2011a6418769b660977aecd9eb7fef19a8389b","amp;dn":"Strike+Commander+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e2011a6418769b660977aecd9eb7fef19a8389b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,32,17,166,65,135,105,182,96,151,122,236,217,235,127,239,25,168,56,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
