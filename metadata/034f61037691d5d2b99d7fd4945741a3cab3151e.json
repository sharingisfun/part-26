Still there is more at hand for the Rider and his dragon, as Eragon finds himself bound by a tangle of promises he may not be able to keep.\n\nFirst is Eragon&amp;#039;s oath to his cousin Roran: to help rescue Roran&amp;#039;s beloved, Katrina, from King Galbatorix&amp;#039;s clutches. But Eragon owes his loyalty to others, too. The Varden are in desperate need of his talents and strength - as are the elves and dwarves. When unrest claims the rebels and danger strikes from every corner, Eragon must make choices - choices that take him across the Empire and beyond, choices that may lead to unimagined sacrifice.\n\nEragon is the greatest hope to rid the land of tyranny. Can this once-simple farm boy unite the rebel forces and defeat the king?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:034f61037691d5d2b99d7fd4945741a3cab3151e","amp;dn":"Brisingr.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"034f61037691d5d2b99d7fd4945741a3cab3151e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,79,97,3,118,145,213,210,185,157,127,212,148,87,65,163,202,179,21,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
