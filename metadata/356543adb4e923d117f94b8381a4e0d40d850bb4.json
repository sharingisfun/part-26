Beginning with a historical introduction that examines Newton's laws, Earth's Magnetosphere then explores Maxwell's equations and subsidiary equations such as continuity, constitutive relations, and the Lorentz transformation; Helmholtz' theorem; and Poynting's theorem, among other methods for understanding this exchange.\n\nThis book includes more than 200 illustrations and features concepts including:\n\n    * Two efficient particle energization mechanisms\n\n    * Plasma Transfer Event (PTE)\n\n    * Low-Latitude Boundary Layer\n\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 536 pages\n    * Publisher: Elsevier Science; 1 edition (October 27, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0444528644\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0444528643","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:356543adb4e923d117f94b8381a4e0d40d850bb4","amp;dn":"Earth%5C%27s+Magnetosphere+%2C1st+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"356543adb4e923d117f94b8381a4e0d40d850bb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,101,67,173,180,233,35,209,23,249,75,131,129,164,224,212,13,133,11,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
