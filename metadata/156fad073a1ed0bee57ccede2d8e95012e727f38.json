Much credit goes to producer Ralph Sall, who--in addition to setting up collaborations between the surviving Doors and an array of artists from John Lee Hooker to Days of the New--also breaks out the beats and samples to create a few &quot;new&quot; Doors tracks. While Sall is no Fatboy Slim (despite the winking nod to &quot;Bird of Prey&quot; during the fadeout of &quot;Under Waterfall&quot;), his reconstructions add texture and variety, especially when the late William Burroughs steps up to the mic. But the true highlights here are the more organic collaborations: the three remaining Doors backing Bo Diddley and Ian Astbury; an unexpectedly great &quot;Love Me Two Times&quot; from Aerosmith; and Stone Temple Pilots helping Kreiger and Manzarek &quot;Break on Through&quot; even harder on a track that threatens to transcend the original. Hell, even the weaker contributions beat out Jose Feliciano. Come to think of it, if the Doors are still auditioning Morrison replacements (Kevin Coyne and Howard Werth no longer being available), STP's Weiland, Creed's Stapp, or the Cult's Astbury all acquit themselves well enough here to warrant an offer. -- Bill Forman\n\nVarious Artists / Stoned Immaculate: The Music Of The Doors\nLabel: Elektra/Asylum\nYear: 2000\nTrack Title\t\n1.
