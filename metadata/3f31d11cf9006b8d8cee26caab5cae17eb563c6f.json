Having been a part of some of the 1990's biggest alternative acts, Letters to Cleo and Veruca Salt, Jones turned his experience inside out for his own musical project. While working on Nina Gordon's Tonight and the Rest of My Life solo album, Jones looked toward the vibrancy of Cheap Trick and cast the healthy rock sounds of American Hi-Fi. Jones, guitarist Jaime Arentzen, bassist Drew Parsons, and drummer Brian Nolan established home base in his native Boston and signed to Island to issue their eponymous debut in 2001. The album spawned the catchy radio single &quot;Flavor of the Weak&quot;, and was followed by plenty of touring, Live From Tokyo (2002), and Art of Losing (2003). And yet, soon after Losing's release, Island gave American Hi-Fi the heave-ho. Undeterred, Jones moved Hi-Fi's HQ to Los Angeles, hooked up with producer Butch Walker, and got to work recording a new record. Hearts on Parade was released in Japan first, and as they shopped for a domestic label Jones and his band went out on tour with Walker. Maverick eventually expressed interest, and Parade was issued stateside in April 2005. In 2007 the band announced they were going to work on a new album, but trouble with their record label pushed back the release date. The band eventually formed their own label, Hi-Fi Killers, and 2010 released their fourth album, Fight the Frequency.\n\n  After a relatively quiet spell -- mainly due to Jones' and Arentzen's involvement in organizing and playing as part of Miley Cyrus's live band -- American Hi-Fi found their impetus again following a sold-out show at London's 100 Club in May 2014. Jones later admitted that they hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been a fully-functioning band since 2005, but the buzz created by this low-key gig inspired them to set about recording another album. Expected that September much of Blood &amp; Lemonade was co-written with former Wire Train member, Kevin Hunter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f31d11cf9006b8d8cee26caab5cae17eb563c6f","amp;dn":"American+Hi-Fi+-+Blood+%26amp%3B+Lemonade+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f31d11cf9006b8d8cee26caab5cae17eb563c6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,49,209,28,249,0,107,141,140,238,38,202,171,92,174,23,235,86,60,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
