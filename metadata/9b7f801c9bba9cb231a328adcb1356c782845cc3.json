As with all Bear Family releases, Wishful\nThinking also includes extensive liner notes, and the first full-length Wynn Stewart\nbiography is part of the package as well. Wishful Thinking is a treasure for his longtime fans","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b7f801c9bba9cb231a328adcb1356c782845cc3","amp;dn":"Wynn+Stewart+-+Wishful+Thinking+%5B2000%5D+%5BBear+Family+Records+10+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b7f801c9bba9cb231a328adcb1356c782845cc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,127,128,28,155,186,156,178,49,163,40,173,203,19,86,199,130,132,92,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
