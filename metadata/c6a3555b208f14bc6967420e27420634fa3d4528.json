Made with unique access to his private life, this is an intimate and moving journey into Stephen Hawking's past and present. Interviewees include Stephen Hawking's sister Mary, his ex-wife Jane, carers and students, as well as colleagues such as Roger Penrose, plus Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin, actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Jim Carrey, and Sir Richard Branson This inspirational portrait of an iconic figure relates Hawking's incredible personal journey from boyhood underachiever to scientific genius and multi-million-selling author. And it charts how he overcame being diagnosed with motor neurone disease - and being given just two years to live - to make amazing scientific discoveries and become a symbol of triumph over adversity. Born exactly 300 years after the death of Galileo, Hawking grew up in a family some regarded as eccentric. Always asking questions, he was nicknamed 'Einstein' at school. Hawking blossomed at Oxford, although he only spent an hour a day studying. He noticed that he was becoming clumsy and fell over for no apparent reason. He was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, but nevertheless started a family and embarked on his academic career, finding himself at the heart of a searing scientific debate about the origins of the universe. And as he lost the use of his body, Hawking had to find new ways to think. He went on to write the huge bestseller A Brief History of Time, and the film reveals the high and lows of his resulting fame and fortune.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\nA-Brief-History-of-Mine-Screen0.jpg A-Brief-History-of-Mine-Screen1.jpg A-Brief-History-of-Mine-Screen2.jpg A-Brief-History-of-Mine-Screen3.jpg A-Brief-History-of-Mine-Screen4.jpg A-Brief-History-of-Mine-Screen5.jpg A-Brief-History-of-Mine-Screen6.jpg A-Brief-History-of-Mine-Screen7.jpg A-Brief-History-of-Mine-Screen8.jpg \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7a371b13143a3649544b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1445 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 89mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 1\n * Part Size: 912 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Stephen%20Hawking%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Everything&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Stephen%20Hawking%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Everything&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Stephen%20Hawking%20-%20Master%20of%20the%20Universe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Stephen%20Hawking%20-%20Master%20of%20the%20Universe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Stephen%20Hawking%27s%20Universe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Stephen%20Hawking%27s%20Universe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Stephen%20Hawking%27s%3A%20Grand%20Design&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Stephen%20Hawking%27s%3A%20Grand%20Design&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Hawking%20Paradox%20%28BBC%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Hawking%20Paradox%20%28BBC%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6a3555b208f14bc6967420e27420634fa3d4528","amp;dn":"Ch4+Stephen+Hawking+A+Brief+History+of+Mine+PDTV+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6a3555b208f14bc6967420e27420634fa3d4528","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,163,85,91,32,143,20,188,105,103,66,14,39,66,6,52,250,61,69,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
