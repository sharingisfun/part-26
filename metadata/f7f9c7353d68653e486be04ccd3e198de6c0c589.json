How could there BE that much money to lend?\n\nThe answer is... there isn't. Today, money IS debt.\n\nIf there were NO DEBT, there would be NO MONEY.\n\nIf this is puzzling to you, you are not alone. Very few people understand, even though ALL OF US are affected.\n\nThis fast-paced and highly entertaining animated feature by artist and videographer Paul Grignon explains today's magically perverse debt-money system in terms that are easy to understand.\n\n---\n\nNTSC DVD ISO, direct untouched rip from original disc. Nothing added, nothing taken away. NTSC, 640x480, interlaced (unfortunately). Cover JPG (ridiculously overkill 600 dpi scan) included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7f9c7353d68653e486be04ccd3e198de6c0c589","amp;dn":"Money+As+Debt+-+Untouched+DVD+ISO+%2B+Cover","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7f9c7353d68653e486be04ccd3e198de6c0c589","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,249,199,53,61,104,101,62,72,107,224,76,205,62,25,141,230,192,197,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
