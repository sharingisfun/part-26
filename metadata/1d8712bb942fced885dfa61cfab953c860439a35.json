Anna Jo (Han Ye Seul) is a rude, feisty, and audacious American-bred heiress who can never be satisfied. She returns to Korea only to continue being a controlling wife to her already cowardly husband, Billy Park (Kim Sung Min). When her yacht gets stuck for repairs, she hires local handyman Jang Chul Soo (Oh Ji Ho) to fix her shower, but when they have a heated spat over her dissatisfaction and non payment, she pushes him overboard and dunks his tools into the ocean right along with him. Later, after a quarrel with Billy that threatens to end their marriage, she herself gets drunkenly pitched overboard and falls victim to a bad case of amnesia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d8712bb942fced885dfa61cfab953c860439a35","amp;dn":"Fantasy+Couple+E12+%28K-Drama%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d8712bb942fced885dfa61cfab953c860439a35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,135,18,187,148,47,206,216,133,223,166,28,250,185,83,200,96,67,154,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
