A groundbreaking album, dominated by Sussan DeyhimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sublime voice surging from behind virtual dunes and electronic oases, which prompted writer Paul Bowles to wonder: &quot;Was this composed under the influence of Majoun ?&quot;... and which convinced filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci to entrust most of the soundtrack music for his Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sheltering SkyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ movie to Richard Horowitz. Since Ã¢â‚¬Å“Desert EquationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Sussan Deyhim has worked with the likes of Peter Gabriel, Bill Laswell, Jah Wobble, Bobby McFerrin, Adrian Sherwood and Ornette Coleman. She has released the acclaimed Ã¢â‚¬Å“Madman Of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Crammed, 2000) an album based on classic Persian Sufi poetry.\nReviews\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Perhaps you could call it techno-ethno pop, or world beat... a hi-tech confluence of muezzin scales, micro-tonal music and ceremonial choreography. (Melody Maker, UK, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ89)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Haunting, always compelling, Desert Equations is proof that ethnic musical skills and new technology can collide harmoniously.
