Its first album, Under the Skin, was somewhat similar to the industrial metal of Broadrick's Godflesh, but with a more experimentalist bent, notably via Martin's free jazz-influenced saxophone. By Bad Blood, its second album, the band had absorbed a great deal of hip-hop influence, and nearly all the songs featured contributions from guests well known in underground hip hop, including El-P. However, the experimentalism continued, with singer Blixa Bargeld of legendary industrial band EinstÃƒÂ¼rzende Neubauten appearing as well, often alongside the emcees. According to critic Ned Raggett, the experiments are not always successful, but he credits the band for expanding its sound.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n(1995) - Quarantine - 224-320kbps (3 tracks)\n\n(1998) - Bad Blood - lossless (Flac)  (7 tracks)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have more albums by ICE, pleaz upload them and link them in comments.\n\n\nenjoy and keep seeding!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc9fa4c79d7384194053258c291bbd1ba31673eb","amp;dn":"ICE+%28Martin%2C+Broadrick%2C+Cochrane+and+co%29+-+2+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc9fa4c79d7384194053258c291bbd1ba31673eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,159,164,199,157,115,132,25,64,83,37,140,41,27,189,27,163,22,115,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
