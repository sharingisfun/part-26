As the author of Scientific American's &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column for 25 years, he gained a large following among puzzlers, magicians, and mathematicians.\nIn the years since then, Gardner has continued to write articles for academic journals and popular magazines. Forty-one of those pieces, never before published in book form, are collected in this volume.Truly a treat for Martin Gardner's many fans, the articles span a wide range of topics. They include games of chance (and why a &quot;computer&quot; will always beat a human player), word ladders and mathematical word play games, tiling puzzles, magic squares, computer and calculator &quot;magic&quot; tricks, and other mathematical puzzles.\nProviding the tools to furnish our all-too-sluggish minds with an athletic workout, Gardner's problems foster an agility of the mind as they entertain.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9cd8d35d910312a62ef9f45267652d868ac0a88","amp;dn":"A+Gardner%27s+Workout+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9cd8d35d910312a62ef9f45267652d868ac0a88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,205,141,53,217,16,49,42,98,239,159,69,38,118,82,216,104,172,10,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
