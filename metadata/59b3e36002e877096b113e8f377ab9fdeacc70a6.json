For over four decades, they have changed modern music as we know it. But some of their most famous performances have never been released... until now. On December 15, 1977, The Who performed before a select invited audience at the Gaumont State Theatre in Kilburn, North London, to record a concert for Jeff Stein's film, The Kids Are Alright, which turned out to be one of the last live performances by drummer Keith Moon. Shot in 35mm, this holy grail for fans has been digitally restored and remastered in high-definitiion for the ultimate The Who experience.\nKilburn Songs: &quot;Can't Explain,&quot; &quot;Substitute,&quot; &quot;Baba O'Reilly (Teenage Wasteland),&quot; &quot;My Wife / Going Mobile,&quot; &quot;Behind Blue Eyes,&quot; &quot;Dreaming from the Waist,&quot; &quot;Pinball Wizard,&quot; &quot;I'm Free,&quot; &quot;Tommy's Holiday Camp,&quot; &quot;Summertime Blues,&quot; &quot;Shakin' All Over,&quot; &quot;My Generation,&quot; &quot;Join Together,&quot; &quot;Who Are You?,&quot; &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again.&quot; London Coliseum Songs: &quot;Heaven and Hell,&quot; &quot;Can't Explain,&quot; &quot;Fortune Teller,&quot; &quot;Tattoo,&quot; &quot;Young Man Blues,&quot; &quot;A Quick One While He's Away,&quot; &quot;Happy Jack,&quot; &quot;I'm a Boy,&quot; &quot;I'm Free,&quot; &quot;Tommy's Holiday Camp,&quot; &quot;See Me, Feel Me,&quot; &quot;Summertime Blues,&quot; &quot;Shakin' All Over,&quot; &quot;My Generation&quot;\n*This contains only the Kilburn show.   \n\nCAST:\nRoger Daltrey\nJohn Entwistle\nPete Townshend\nKeith Moon\n\nINFO:\nResolution- 720x480\nFrame Rate- 29.97fps\nPixel Shape- 40:33(NTSC 16:9)\nVideo Structure- Progressive\nDuration- 01:05:40.\nSize: 693MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59b3e36002e877096b113e8f377ab9fdeacc70a6","amp;dn":"The+Who+at+Kilburn%28live+1977%29%7Bdvdripmp4%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59b3e36002e877096b113e8f377ab9fdeacc70a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,179,227,96,2,232,119,9,107,17,62,143,55,122,185,253,234,204,112,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
