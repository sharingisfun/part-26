Eric Tsang is a riot to watch with Jet Li...they have fantastic chemistry...esp. the scene where Jet Li decides to move in with him and Tsang pretends that he wants him to. lol. As for the fighting elements: Jet Li pulls a few moves throughout the movie, but nothing spectacular...then at the end, he tears it up!! The movie has several hilariously memorable characters like the head of the trust board who insists &quot;Yes, I&amp;#039;m afraid of you, but I&amp;#039;m more afraid of starving&quot;...I honestly felt that Simon Yam&amp;#039;s character was a bit extraneous, he certainly doesn&amp;#039;t have the skills that Jet Li has and he&amp;#039;s very unimpressive without a gun in his hands. The scene with Eric Tsang fighting the Japanese woman is too funny. Esp. when he says &quot;I&amp;#039;ll take on the toughest one - the girl in the kimono&quot;. The final fight scene is great enough to buy the movie and the very end has a nice feel-good sentiment. No stupid romances to clog up the movie.\n\nEnjoy and plaese seed.
