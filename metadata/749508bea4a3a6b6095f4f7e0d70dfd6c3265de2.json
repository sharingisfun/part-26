Its dreamlike action begins among the decayed plantation houses and overwhelming natural abundance of late nineteenth-century Jamaica, before moving out onto the high seas, as Hughes tells the story of a group of children thrown upon the mercy of a crew of down-at-the-heel pirates. A tale of seduction and betrayal, of accommodation and manipulation, of weird humor and unforeseen violence, this classic of twentieth-century literature is above all an extraordinary reckoning with the secret reasons and otherworldly realities of childhood.\n\nIn 1998, this novel was included as number 71 in the Modern Library's 100 Best Novels, a list of the best English-language novels of the 20th century.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:749508bea4a3a6b6095f4f7e0d70dfd6c3265de2","amp;dn":"A+High+Wind+in+Jamaica+-+Richard+Hughes+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"749508bea4a3a6b6095f4f7e0d70dfd6c3265de2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,149,8,190,164,163,166,182,9,95,79,126,13,112,223,214,195,38,93,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
