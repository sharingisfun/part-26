The E 18 is a German electric locomotive built from 1935 to 1939, and again briefly from 1954 to 1955. The design was based on the earlier E17, which had been a major step forward over slower previous electric locomotives. Thanks partly to its basic streamlining, the E18 was an even better performer with a top speed of 150km/h, despite weighing a hefty 108 tons. Following World War 2, the E18 was operated in West Germany and Austria, though much of the electrified lines in East Germany were unusable so some examples remaining in East Germany were sold to West Germanys Deutsche Bundesbahn. A total of 55 examples were built, and incredibly the E18 remained in service until 1984 with 6 remaining in preservation today.\n\nThe E18 Passenger Add-On includes the E18 locomotive in blue, green and ocean-blue/beige liveries plus Schnellzugwagen in blue/green and ocean-blue/beige and Silberlinge coaches.\n\nKey Features\nE18 electric locomotive in blue, green and ocean-blue/beige liveries\nSchnellzugwagen coaches in blue/green and ocean-blue/beige\nSilberlinge coaches\n6 scenarios for Hagen-Siegen and Seeburgbahn:\nNorddeich Mole Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Frankfurt / Main\nHelping Hand\nTrain Takeover\nLocal Traffic Service\nRepainting\nBR118 between Lenne and Ebbe mountains","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aef790f7ec9511df6185ee3641d937f65546d02d","amp;dn":"RailWorks+-+E18+Passenger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aef790f7ec9511df6185ee3641d937f65546d02d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,247,144,247,236,149,17,223,97,133,238,54,65,217,55,246,85,70,208,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
