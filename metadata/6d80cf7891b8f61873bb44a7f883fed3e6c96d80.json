The primary focus of the graphic novel is dark humor, with many of the stories having amusing twist endings. Common themes are the reinvention of children's songs, games, and nursery rhymes to something more macabre, and subverting all sorts of pop culture icons and cultural figures in to topics of dark comedy. While Lenore's actions often result in the death or injury to those around her, and in various forms of chaos, she is not a malicious character, and often thinks she is doing good.\n\nLenore, the Cute Little Dead Girl was created by Roman Dirge and inspired by the poem &quot;Lenore,&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe. \n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d80cf7891b8f61873bb44a7f883fed3e6c96d80","amp;dn":"Lenore+%28SLG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d80cf7891b8f61873bb44a7f883fed3e6c96d80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,128,207,120,145,184,246,24,115,187,68,167,248,131,254,211,230,201,109,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
