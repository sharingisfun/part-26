It was officially announced on November 8, 2013 at BlizzCon 2013.\n\nAcross Draenor's savage jungles and battle-scarred plains, Azeroth's heroes will engage in a mythic conflict involving mystical draenei champions and mighty orc clans, and cross axes with the likes of Grommash Hellscream, Blackhand, and NerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢zhul at the height of their primal power. Players will need to scour this unwelcoming land in search of allies to help build a desperate defense against the old HordeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s formidable engine of conquestÃ¢â‚¬â€or else watch their own worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bloody, war-torn history repeat itself.\n\nWarlords of Draenor is the first expansion pack to exist primarily before the main timeline, and depicts a timeline that branches from the original.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43be7086d3ba87a53419b27c7a0eba77e4911045","amp;dn":"World+of+Warcraft+Warlords+of+Draenor+720pHD+Trailer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43be7086d3ba87a53419b27c7a0eba77e4911045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,190,112,134,211,186,135,165,52,25,178,124,122,14,186,119,228,145,16,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
