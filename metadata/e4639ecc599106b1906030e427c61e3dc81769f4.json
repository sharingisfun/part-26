The curriculum of all mathematics (pure or applied) and physics programs include a compulsory course in mathematical analysis. This book will serve as can serve a main textbook of such (one semester) courses. The book can also serve as additional reading for such courses as real analysis, functional analysis, harmonic analysis etc. For non-math major students requiring math beyond calculus, this is a more friendly approach than many math-centric options.\n\n- Friendly and well-rounded presentation of pre-analysis topics such as sets, proof techniques and systems of numbers.\n- Deeper discussion of the basic concept of convergence for the system of real numbers, pointing out its specific features, and for metric spaces\n- Presentation of Riemann integration and its place in the whole integration theory for single variable, including the Kurzweil-Henstock integration\n- Elements of multiplicative calculus aiming to demonstrate the non-absoluteness of Newtonian calculus","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4639ecc599106b1906030e427c61e3dc81769f4","amp;dn":"Mathematical+Analysis+Fundamentals+%5B2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4639ecc599106b1906030e427c61e3dc81769f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,99,158,204,89,145,6,177,144,96,48,228,39,198,30,61,200,23,105,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
