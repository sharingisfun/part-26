Jesse is also struggling to maintain his relationship with his teenage son, Hank, who lives in Chicago with Jesse's ex-wife and who, after spending the summer with Jesse and Celine on the Greek Peloponnese peninsula, is being dropped off at the airport to fly home. Jesse has continued to find success as a novelist, while Celine is at a career crossroads, considering a job in the government.\n\nAfter dropping off Hank at the airport, the couple discuss their worries about Hank having a healthy childhood and Celine deciding what to do with her career, before returning to the house of their Greek friend, Patrick. Over dinner they discuss ideas about love and life, and the other people staying with them buy Jesse and Celine a hotel room for that night so they can have some time alone. While walking to the hotel, the couple reminisces about how they met and how their lives have changed since then. When they arrive at the hotel, however, the two have a vicious argument, as both of them pour out their fears about a present and future together.\n\nCeline eventually storms out of the hotel room, telling Jesse she doesn't think she loves him anymore before sitting in the hotel's outdoor restaurant alone. Jesse joins her and playfully tries to explain to her how things can be different from tonight. Celine initially finds his attempts childish, saying that their fantasies will never match the imperfect reality their relationship constantly goes through. Jesse then proclaims his love to her, saying that he loves her unconditionally and is not sure what else she could want from a relationship. Celine suddenly resumes Jesse's joke, and the two seem to reconcile.\n\nGeneral\n\nFormat                                   : Flash Video\nFile size                                : 464 MiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 48mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 597 Kbps\nTagging application                      : Yet Another Metadata Injector for FLV - Version 1.9\n\nVideo\n\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;cf87a6a8a78f83fce1ff&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : 7\nDuration                                 : 1h 48mn\nBit rate                                 : 466 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 500 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 640 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.086\nStream size                              : 373 MiB (80%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 118\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 10\nDuration                                 : 1h 48mn\nBit rate                                 : 109 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nDelay relative to video                  : 42ms\nStream size                              : 89.4 MiB (19%)\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42138aadeecb160506e659ff7a55651c064d3c6e","amp;dn":"Before+Midnight+HDRip.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42138aadeecb160506e659ff7a55651c064d3c6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,19,138,173,238,203,22,5,6,230,89,255,122,85,101,28,6,77,60,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
