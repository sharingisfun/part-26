As a patient's most tangible source of information about what drug has been prescribed and how that drug is to be taken, the label on a container of prescription medication is a crucial line of defense against such medication safety problems, yet almost half of all patients misunderstand label instructions about how to take their medicines. Standardizing Medication Labels: Confusing Patients Less is the summary of a workshop, held in Washington, D.C. on October 12, 2007, that was organized to examine what is known about how medication container labeling affects patient safety and to discuss approaches to addressing identified problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e5f53f68e2ed1f1868102b04ffbcc4406948bf7","amp;dn":"Standardizing+Medication+Labels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e5f53f68e2ed1f1868102b04ffbcc4406948bf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,95,83,246,142,46,209,241,134,129,2,176,79,251,204,68,6,148,139,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
