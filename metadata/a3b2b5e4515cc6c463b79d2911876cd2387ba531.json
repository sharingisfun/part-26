Clay from many different parts of Cornwall and Devon are carried by rail to Fowey where it is loaded onto waiting ships from all parts of the globe.\n\nThis is your chance to sign-on at St Blazey depot. Jump aboard your loco for the day and head off to Rocks Dryers to pick up a train of china clay. Can you manage to get this heavy train to Carne Point and return with empties whilst observing all speed limits, along the steep gradients and twisting lines?\n\nOr would you prefer taking control of the local passenger service, calling at all stops, through the delightful Cornish countryside?\n\nThis charming little route of around 20 miles will offer many differing challenges, with the player free to choose a variety of tasks to perform, whilst closely observing railway procedures\n\n________________________\n\nMy internet conection is up only in the day. I going to seed to best ratio, but be patient.
