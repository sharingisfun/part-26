Many thanks!\n\nI&amp;#039;ve added five issues to the collection and changed all the file names to the standard three-digit format (046, 047, 048, etc.) because most comic book reading programs I tested in didn&amp;#039;t progress from issue to issue quite right. You would be reading issue #19, click Next to jump to the next archive, and it would jump to issue #2 instead of #20. Using the three-digit format, problem solved.\n\nPlentiful kudos to the original scanners. Great job, people.\n\nAnd, as always, if you like it, BUY IT. Support the artists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95d9407612b29cce0e679807b2389978d42b6f7e","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95d9407612b29cce0e679807b2389978d42b6f7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,217,64,118,18,178,156,206,14,103,152,7,178,56,153,120,212,43,111,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
