Full Descriptionto \nget airplay on pop radio. \n\nBORN IN THE USA was the album on which he flexed his muscles (literally) and changed all that. \nWith song titles and choruses that seemed to reflect all that was good and strong in America, \nbelying songs that were about everything that was going wrong, BORN IN THE USA was one of those \ncultural events that resonated with just about everybody--from both Republican and Democratic \npoliticians, to Vietnam veterans (the title-track was a brutal account of a vet's homecoming), \nto social critics who found layers of meaning in these tales of disillusioned America, to \ndance-music DJs who found palpable beats in the dark passions of &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot; and \n&quot;Cover Me,&quot; to fist-raising pop fans who turned seven of these songs into top-10 singles and \nkept BORN IN THE USA in a year-long battle for the top spot on the album chart. It was as if \nno other album mattered that year. \n\n[code]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-downloads.to:5869/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nemesis.1337x.org/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nemesis.1337x.org/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pow7.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pow7.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n[/code]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dde4316f2e09f0b4fd118d97575a6d6fbd0fdf3","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+Born+in+the+U+S+A+%28EAC+FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dde4316f2e09f0b4fd118d97575a6d6fbd0fdf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,222,67,22,242,224,159,11,79,209,24,217,117,117,166,214,251,208,253,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
