It reconstructs several of Freud's works on ordinary mental life, tracking his method of inquiry, in particular his search for the child within the adult, and culminating in a deployment of his tools independently of his analyses. It shows how to read Freud for his insight and generativity and how to push beyond the confines of his analyses in pursuit of new lines of exploration. In this endeavor, in turn, it at once echoes and encourages the spirit of play with ideas so characteristic of, and so engaging in, Freud.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcb819a4fca193f32b0f632627ab8c2d670608f0","amp;dn":"Freud+on+the+Psychology+of+Ordinary+Mental+Life.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcb819a4fca193f32b0f632627ab8c2d670608f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,184,25,164,252,161,147,243,43,15,99,38,39,171,140,45,103,6,8,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
