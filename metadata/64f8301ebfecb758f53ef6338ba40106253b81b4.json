It also spawned a top 75 hit in the shape of &quot;Lil' Dub Chefin,&quot; the remix of cult favourite album track &quot;M1 A1&quot; later that month. The Ltd. Edition CD (packaged in a tri-fold digipak) &amp; Vinyl editions of the album also contained a bonus mix of Clint Eastwood as a hidden track. The vinyl also contains an alternate mix of Slow Country. The album is titled &quot;Laika&quot; as in the first dog in space.\n\nCharts\n\nDue to chart rules concerning remixes at the time, sales of Laika Come Home counted for the parent album Gorillaz in the album charts.\n\nArtwork\n\nPromo Photo 1\nPromo Photo 2\n\nWhat They Said\n\n&quot;Some premium-grade dub spliced with insidiously catchy, offbeat pop tunes is just what the doctor ordered.&quot; - Ministry\n&quot;This is a musically-credible dub album which will perhaps find most of its audience at the adventurous end of the pop market.&quot; - Music Week\n&quot;The album is rife with excellent brass arrangements that pay homage to The Specials and 2-Tone.&quot; - NME\n&quot;A superb companion piece to the original.&quot; - Q\n&quot;Pleasant enough stuff, for sure, especially when the Space Monkeyz really get to work on the Augustus Pablo-like cuts, adding even softer edge to their already blissed-out haze.&quot; - Seven\n&quot;A novel experiment.&quot; - Uncut\n\nPromos\n\nCD: SMVG 001\n01.
