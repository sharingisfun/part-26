There are also full-page mock advertisements marketing futuristic products (such as Brain Slugs), which parody the kinds of coupon offers found in other comic books.\nSpecial editions of some issues are published on occasion; a variant of the first issue available only at Comic Con 2000 featured a golden background, rather than red.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1c17dd82cec6c4888c384fd805476af6206be54","amp;dn":"Futurama+Comics+%23%2301-61%2BCrossovers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1c17dd82cec6c4888c384fd805476af6206be54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,193,125,216,44,236,108,72,136,195,132,253,128,84,118,175,98,6,190,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
