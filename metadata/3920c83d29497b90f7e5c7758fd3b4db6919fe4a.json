The album was released by Gramavision records in 1993 and was produced by Bill Laswell and Bernie Worrell. The album represents a P-Funk reunion of sorts, as it features guest appearances by George Clinton, bassist Bootsy Collins, trombonist Fred Wesley, saxophonist Maceo Parker and P-Funk vocalist Gary Cooper. It would also be the last album that Bernie Worrell would record for the Gramavision label.\n\nTrack listing\n\n    &quot;Revelation In Black Light&quot; (Worrell) 2:24\n    &quot;Flex&quot; (Worrell, James Sumbi, Bill Laswell, Mike Small, George Clinton) 6:03\n    &quot;Time Was (Events in the Elsewhere)&quot; (Worrell, George Clinton, Bill Laswell, Bootsy Collins) 7:20\n    &quot;Blood Secrets&quot; (Worrell) 6:47\n    &quot;Dissinfordollars&quot; (Worrell, George Clinton, Bootsy Collins) 6:30\n    &quot;The Vision&quot; (Worrell, James Sumbi, Mike Small, Bill Laswell) 8:03\n    &quot;Won't Go Away&quot; (Worrell, Mike Small, Bill Laswell) 5:56\n    &quot;X-Factor&quot; (Worrell, Maceo Parker) 11:51\n    &quot;Disappearance&quot; (Worrell) 0:51\n\n\nBernie Worrell - Organ, Harpsichord, Synthesizer, Mini-Moog, Clavinet\nBootsy Collins - Guitar, Bass, Vocals\nGeorge Clinton - Vocals\nMaceo Parker - Alto Saxophone, Flute\nFred Wesley - Trombone\nBill Laswell - Bass, Loops, Sound Effects, Beats\nSly Dunbar - Drums\nTony Williams - Drums\nAÃ„Â©yb Dieng - Chatan, Talking Drums, Chaton, Cowbells\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/blacktronic-science-mw0000095566&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/blacktronic-science-mw0000095566&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3920c83d29497b90f7e5c7758fd3b4db6919fe4a","amp;dn":"Bernie+Worrell+-+Blacktronic+Science+%281993%29+Funkadelic+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3920c83d29497b90f7e5c7758fd3b4db6919fe4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,32,200,61,41,73,123,144,247,229,199,117,143,211,180,219,105,25,254,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
