DeMille. The story relates the life of Moses, from the time he was discovered in the bullrushes as an infant by the pharoah's daughter, to his long, hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses (Charlton Heston) starts out &quot;in solid&quot; as Pharoah's adopted son (and a whiz at designing pyramids, dispensing such construction-site advice as &quot;Blood makes poor mortar&quot;), but when he discovers his true Hebrew heritage, he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous half-brother Rameses (Yul Brynner), Moses returns fully bearded to Pharoah's court, warning that he's had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews post-haste if they know what's good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea, they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later, Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai, who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile, the Hebrews, led by the duplicitous Dathan (Edward G. Robinson), are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines. &quot;Where's your Moses now?&quot; brays Dathan in the manner of a Lower East Side gangster. He soon finds out.\n\nCharlton Heston, Yul Brynner and Anne Baxter\n\n\n\nTen Commandments (1956) DVDrip [18+Greek Subs] OmifastÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Media Info\n\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFile size                        : 756 MiB\nDuration                         : 2h 10mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 811 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nCodec ID/Info                    : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                         : 2h 10mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 728 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 2 592 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                  : Constant\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nStandard                         : PAL\nStream size                      : 678 MiB (90%)\nLanguage                         : English\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                   : HE-AAC / LC\nCodec ID                         : 40\nDuration                         : 2h 10mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 80.0 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 94.2 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz / 24.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 74.5 MiB (10%)\nLanguage                         : English\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33f9c2206d39db81e4aca5e84b4364640a57736c","amp;dn":"Ten+Commandments+%281956%29+DVDrip+%5B18%2BGreek+Subs%5D+Omifast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33f9c2206d39db81e4aca5e84b4364640a57736c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,249,194,32,109,57,219,129,228,172,165,232,75,67,100,100,10,87,115,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
