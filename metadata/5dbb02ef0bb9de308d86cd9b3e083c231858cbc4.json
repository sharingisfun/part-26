And his singing matchesÃ¢â‚¬â€a gravelly, boozey voice right smack between Tom Waits and Dr. John. Oldtimey swing, Ã¢â‚¬â„¢50s Memphis soul and Chicago blues: Bob turns all that into a magic brew on songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who Will The Next Fool Be,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gee Baby, AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t I Good To You,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a devastating Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cottage For SaleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. A Sheryl Crow-style background singer, a prize-winning swing fiddler and a snare-and-brushes master round out the prohibition watering hole atmosphere. (mapleshaderecords)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Sugar Babe\n02 - Goin' to Chicago\n03 - Laughing on the outside\n04 - The dark end of the street\n05 - Sometimes I'm happy\n06 - Cottage for sale\n07 - If I could be with you\n08 - Gee baby, ain't I good to you\n09 - A hundred years from today\n10 - Blue and sentimental\n11 - Careless love\n12 - Who will your next fool be\n13 - I wanna go home\n\nPersonnel:\nPaul Murphy - drums\nKevin Wimmer - fiddle\nAmy Sarli - vocals\nBob Willoughby - vocals, piano\n\nNo log.
