Collectively, this legislation is known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrisk regulationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ because it addresses the risk of harm that technology creates for individuals and the environment. In the last two decades, this legislation has come under increasing attack by critics who employ utilitarian philosophy and cost-benefit analysis. The defenders of this body of risk regulation, by contrast, have lacked a similar unifying theory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:699d044af0b8f92ebe4c7ceca0ea57820036c7e6","amp;dn":"Risk+Regulation+at+Risk%3A+Restoring+a+Pragmatic+Approach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"699d044af0b8f92ebe4c7ceca0ea57820036c7e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,157,4,74,240,184,249,46,190,76,124,236,160,234,87,130,0,54,199,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
