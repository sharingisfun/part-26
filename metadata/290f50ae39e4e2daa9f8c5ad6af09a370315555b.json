The first series, SGNLF #01?#05, released exclusively on vinyl, comprised of split releases by two topical artists on records smartly clad in black &amp; white photographic sleeves, seamlessly in line with the aesthetics of the label?s drum machine driven musical outlet. SGNLF #01?#05 alumni include: Twwth, Desto, Kowton, LAS, Visionist, Last Japan, Zebra Katz &amp; French Fries. The series came with a predetermined quirk, for additional content. Each 12? artwork spine has been equipped with a short dadaist passage, with initials of each word conveniently spelling out SIGNAL LIFE. The passages, function as an easter egg of sort: once entered successively on the label site, will unleash a bundle of exclusive, unreleased and related music. Now, with the fifth release of the instalment out in October 2013, our first series is complete, and we are ready to present a digital compilation titled: DADA SPINES The compilation features exclusive music by past &amp; future Signal Life artists, summing up our first series and paving way for future shit. The sounds?ranging between the bastard techno of Kowton, slower footwork-house-garage crossbreeds by Twwth, N?bome &amp; LAS, dance floor drivers in the 160bpm range ? la Desto, newcomers RPK &amp; Koala, and the big room implying ambience of Twwth &amp; Desto?s Last Japan remix?hold a common denominator in the low end. This is driving raw minimalism, without the cold pretence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:290f50ae39e4e2daa9f8c5ad6af09a370315555b","amp;dn":"VA+-+Dada+Spines+%5BSignal+Life%5D+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"290f50ae39e4e2daa9f8c5ad6af09a370315555b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,15,80,174,57,228,226,218,169,248,197,173,106,240,154,55,3,21,85,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
