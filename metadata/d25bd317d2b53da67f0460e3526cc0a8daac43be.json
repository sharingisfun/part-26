Chapman is on trial for a murder of Latin American villagers while he was in the Marines. Claire soon learns that to navigate the military justice system, she'll need help from the somewhat unconventional Charlie Grimes; meanwhile, Claire's sister, Jackie, is falling in love with wet-behind-the-ears Lieutenant Embry assigned as the official defense lawyer.\n\n\nAll stand-alone DivX Players compatible\n\n\nU P L O A D E R S  F I N A L  N O T E S\n\n\nPlease seed!
