Lenderman&amp;#039;s uneven book presents the new paradigm: experiential marketing (XM), a corporate form of viral marketing that connects the consumer and product in unique one-on-one situations that engage them with the brand in positive-and what the author terms &quot;authentic&quot;-ways. Through eight chapters that expound on Lenderman&amp;#039;s (and others&amp;#039;) 2004 IXMA Manifesto (International Experiential Marketing Association), the Creative Director of GMR Marketing provides scores of examples of XM&amp;#039;s revolutionary approaches to marketing, many of which are employed by big name companies from Proctor and Gamble to Disney to leading car companies. Instead of the car company logo hanging over the concert stage, how about having new models outside where consumers can get in and breathe in that new car smell? While the book&amp;#039;s train of argument wanders as it goes from one campaign to the next, the XM approach is fervently presented as the absolute antidote for dispassionate consumers. Companies looking for new and sophisticated ways to grow and connect their brand with consumers will find this book helpful, as several of its ideas can be adapted and implemented with little capital outlay.\nCopyright Ã‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It&amp;#039;s a cover-to-cover read on a subject that is the future of marketing. Besides being a substantive contribution to marketing literature, Experience the Message is a damn good read.&quot;\n?David Wolfe, Ageless Marketing\n\n&quot;Max Lenderman?s new book will prove to be seminal in our understanding of how the world of marketing is radically changing and how to successfully make that transition. Experience the Message is a must read for thoughtful marketing executives.&quot;\n?Karl Moore, columnist for Marketing Magazine\n\n&quot;With all of the changes occurring in the advertising/marketing world today, we need some new guides and Max is one of them! A book you should have in your library if you&amp;#039;re serious about navigating the new marketing world&quot;\n?David Polinchock, Brand Experience Lab\n\n&quot;To be brief, Max is one of the sharpest minds operating in experiential mediums today. Clearly, the sky is the limit for Max. He is someone to watch closely.&quot;\n?Erik Hauser, CD/Founder Swivel Media ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73dff0ba2caf052b19e7a261393bcf7506b90fe5","amp;dn":"Experience+The+Message","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73dff0ba2caf052b19e7a261393bcf7506b90fe5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,223,240,186,44,175,5,43,25,231,162,97,57,59,207,117,6,185,15,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
