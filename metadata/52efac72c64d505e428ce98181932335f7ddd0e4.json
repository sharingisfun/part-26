It is now about to be attacked by an army of tentacled soul-eaters! To defend the Dungeon, Herbert the Timorous Duck is told to retrieve a fearsome barbarian, only to see him being beheaded. Without the slightest notion of what he is getting himself in for, Herbert mocks himself up as the barbarian. So begins the epic and hilarious story of Dungeons &amp; Ducks - this reissue of a cult classic collects the three main volumes of the series at a great price point.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52efac72c64d505e428ce98181932335f7ddd0e4","amp;dn":"Dungeon+Zenith+%23+1-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52efac72c64d505e428ce98181932335f7ddd0e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,239,172,114,198,77,80,94,66,140,233,129,129,147,35,53,247,221,208,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
