In the beginning they performed as an acoustic country band. After they won at the Paliluska olimpijada culture contest, their popularity started to grow, and the permanent line-up was formed: Nenad RaduloviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡, DraÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ko JankoviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ (guitar), Zorica Ãƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ermanov (vocals), Olivera PeriÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ (violin), SaÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡o Bogojevski (bass guitar), Dragan TodoroviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ (drums), DuÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡an HristiÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ (keyboards) and Dragomir BuliÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ (saxophone). Their debut album Napokon ploÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½a (&quot;At Last, a Record&quot;) was released by ZKP RTLJ on October 11, 1982. They achieved huge success with different musical genres represented on the album, short stories and imitations between the songs. Songs &quot;NataÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡a&quot; and &quot;Vrati se&quot; became big hits. Until the end of the year they held fifteen sold out concert's in Belgrade's Dom sindikata. In the first half of 1983 Dragomir BuliÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ and DuÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡an HristiÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ left the band and keyboardist Slobodan MitiÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ became the band's new member. On September 19, 1983 ZKP RTLJ released band's second studio album Ponovo ploÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½a &amp; druge priÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½e (&quot;Another Record &amp; Other Stories&quot;). Music and lyrics were written by NeÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡a RaduloviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ (except for &quot;OtiÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡i Ãƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡u&quot; for which music was written by Miodrag BoÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾idareviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡). Main hits from this album were &quot;SliÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½uge&quot; and &quot;Hvala ti za muziku&quot;. Near the end of 1984 Olivera PeriÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ and Zorica Ãƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ermanov left the band, and after male members came back from the army, the band started working with singer Lidija AsanoviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ from Zagreb. PGP RTB released their third album Opet ploÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½a - Srce od meda (&quot;Again, a Record - Heart Made of Honey&quot;) on September 17, 1985. Music and lyrics were witen by NeÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡a RaduloviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ (except for &quot;DeÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ko, 'ajde o'ladi&quot; for which music was written by RaduloviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ and SaÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡o Bogojevski). Special guest on this album was Riblja Ãƒâ€žÃ…â€™orba frontman Bora Ãƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½orÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬ËœeviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡. The biggest hit from the album was &quot;DeÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ko, 'ajde o'ladi&quot; which brought them Oskar popularnosti for the pop band of the year. Fourth album Grudi moje Balkanske (&quot;My Balkan Chest&quot;) was released on October 8, 1986 by PGP RTB. Authors of all songs were NeÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡a RaduloviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ and Dragomir Miki StanojeviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡. Songs &quot;Umiru jeleni&quot; and &quot;Taxi&quot; became huge hits, and title track &quot;Grudi moje Balkanske&quot; was released as a single on November 25 and topped charts. Fifth album Zajedno smo piÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡kili u pesku (&quot;We Were Peeing in the Sand Together&quot;) was released on December 8, 1987 by PGP RTB and produced by Kornelije KovaÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½. The title song was composed by Bora Ãƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½orÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬ËœeviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡. Special guest on the album were Jelica SretenoviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ and Aleksandra KovaÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ as backing vocals. Minor hits from this album were &quot;Ruska Ãƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½okolada&quot;, &quot;Zajedno smo piÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡kili u pesku&quot; and &quot;Tibet&quot;.\n\nIn 1989 the band went on hiatus and RaduloviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ released his solo album Niko nema Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡to piton imade (&quot;Nobody has what Python has&quot;). He did not manage to finish his second album, recording only song &quot;Modra bajka'&quot; (&quot;Livid Fairytale&quot;), because he died of tumor on February 12, 1990. ITMM released Modra bajka - Best of in 1997 which featured old Poslednja Igra Leptira hits, song &quot;Modra bajka&quot; and band's live recordings.\n\nIncluded is also a hit collection. Nothing new on that record but it was the first collection ever made and beside Modra bajka the only one ever made. \n\nThis are recordings from Vinyl so donÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t expect top notch quality. It is more for old fans and those who wants to walk down the memory lane a bit.\n\n\n1982 - Napokon Ploca\n1983 - Ponovo ploca &amp; druge price\n1985 - Opet ploca - Srce od meda\n1986 - Grudi Moje Balkanske\n1987 - Zajedno smo piskili u pesku\n1997 - Modra Bajka\nNesa Leptir - 1989 - Niko nema sto piton imade\nPoslednja Igra Leptira - Kolekcija Hitova","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b50f3de1b2c123d621bacf974a6eb39a5e4adde","amp;dn":"Poslednja+igra+leptira","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b50f3de1b2c123d621bacf974a6eb39a5e4adde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,80,243,222,27,44,18,61,98,27,172,249,116,166,235,57,165,228,173,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
