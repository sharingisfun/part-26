It is implied that the title of the manga is derived from the &quot;good endings&quot; that are achieved in harem visual novels. Although the story was once concluded in the one shot version, the full version includes identical characters and settings.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c367852b649e6be9b1d555b03e4ab838ffebb95a","amp;dn":"GE%3A+Good+Ending+-+Vol.+02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c367852b649e6be9b1d555b03e4ab838ffebb95a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,103,133,43,100,158,107,233,177,213,85,176,62,74,184,56,255,235,185,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
