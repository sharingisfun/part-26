The originality of the band lies upon the fusion between Heavy Metal and classical music. This dimension in classical music is added to different Metal influences (Black, Death, Power and Trash Metal) to create an entity that is fresh, exclusive and powerful, thus allowing the band to reach a broader audience that still recognizes the music it is familiar with, while discovering a new style.\n\nEven those who have never been attracted to Heavy Metal music before, appreciate LIVA's originality. As a matter of fact, LIVA stands out from among other band by it's use of soprano vocals, viola and the fact that the lyrics are in latin, which never fails to attract attention.\n\nA lot of live shows were given by LIVA in the province of Quebec. For example, in Montreal, the band played (among other places) the Zest, the CafÃƒÂ© Chaos and La Maison de la culture Frontenac. LIVA also opened for VOIVOD when they played in Sherbrooke during their North American tour in October 2000, and did the same for GORGUTS on September 2nd 2001. On next september 6th 2003, LIVA will play with NIGHTWISH, in Montreal, for their North American tour.\n\n2002 - Requiem\n2007 - De Insulis\n2013 - Human Abstract\n\nwww.livaband.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d44dd00fd5bb6e9f2f5781fb28367a446c7662ee","amp;dn":"Liva+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d44dd00fd5bb6e9f2f5781fb28367a446c7662ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,77,208,15,213,187,110,159,47,87,129,251,40,54,122,68,108,118,98,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
