Founded in Detroit, Michigan as The Four Aims, lead singer Levi\nStubbs [born Levi Stubbles, a cousin of Jackie Wilson and brother of The Falcons' Joe\nStubbs], and groupmates Abdul &quot;Duke&quot; Fakir, Renaldo &quot;Obie&quot; Benson and Lawrence Payton\nremained together for over four decades, having gone from 1953 until 1997 without a single\nchange in personnel.\n\nAmong a number of groups who helped define the Motown Sound of the 1960s, including The\nMiracles, The Marvelettes, Martha and the Vandellas, The Temptations, and The Supremes,\nthe Four Tops were notable for having Stubbs, a baritone, as their lead singer; most groups\nof the time were fronted by a tenor. The group was the main male vocal group for the\nsongwriting and production team of Holland~Dozier~Holland, who crafted a stream of hit\nsingles, including two Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits: &quot;I Can't Help Myself [Sugar Pie\nHoney Bunch]&quot; and &quot;Reach Out I'll Be There&quot;. After Holland-Dozier-Holland left Motown in\n1967, the Four Tops were assigned to a number of producers, primarily Frank Wilson. When\nMotown left Detroit in 1972 to move to Los Angeles, California, the Tops stayed in Detroit and\nmoved over to ABC Records, where they continued to have charting singles into the late-\n1970s. Since the 1980s, the Four Tops have recorded for, at various times, Motown,\nCasablanca Records and Arista Records. Today, save for Indestructible [owned by Sony\nMusic Entertainment], Universal Music Group controls the rights to their entire post-1963\ncatalog [through various mergers and acquisitions], as well as their 1956 single, &quot;Could It Be\nYou&quot;.\n\nA change of line-up was finally forced upon the group when Lawrence Payton died on June\n20, 1997. The band initially continued as a three-piece under the name The Tops, before\nTheo Peoples [formerly of The Temptations] was recruited as the new fourth member.\nPeoples eventually took over the role of lead singer when Stubbs suffered a stroke in 2000\nwith his position assumed by Ronnie McNeir. On July 1, 2005, Benson died of lung cancer\nwith Payton's son Roquel Payton replacing him. As of 2006, Fakir, McNeir, Payton, and\nPeoples were still performing together as the Four Tops. Levi Stubbs died on October 17,\n2008. Fakir is now the only surviving founding member of the original group.\n\n\nEarly years\n\n\n\nAll four members of the group began their careers together while they were high school\nstudents in Detroit. At the insistence of their friends, Pershing High students Levi Stubbs and\nAbdul &quot;Duke&quot; Fakir performed with Renaldo &quot;Obie&quot; Benson and Lawrence Payton from\nNorthern High at a local birthday party. The quartet decided to remain together, and\nchristened themselves The Four Aims. With the help of Payton's songwriter cousin Roquel\nDavis, The Aims signed to Chess Records in 1956, changing their name to Four Tops to\navoid confusion with The Ames Brothers. Over the next seven years, The Tops endured\nunsuccessful tenures at Chess, Red Top, Riverside Records and Columbia Records. Without\nany hit records to their name, The Tops toured frequently, developing a polished stage\npresence and an experienced supper club act. In 1963, Berry Gordy, Jr., who had worked\nwith Roquel Davis as a songwriter in the late~1950s, convinced The Tops to join the roster of\nhis growing Motown record company.\n\n\n\n  01.
