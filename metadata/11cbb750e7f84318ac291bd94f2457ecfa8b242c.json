He is known for his endless cynicism, deadpan snarking, ruthless cunning, and constant chain smoking. A roguish counterculture antihero, Constantine is also a passionate humanist driven by a heartfelt desire to do some good in his life. Originally a supporting character who played a pivotal role in the &quot;American Gothic&quot; Swamp Thing storyline, Constantine received his own comic in 1988. Pop artist Sting was the visual inspiration for John Constantine.\n\nThis is all I could find of his appearances pre-Flashpoint. If anyone knows of other appearances please post them below or better yet upload them. Credit to all the scanners and  original uploaders. Hope some people will enjoy this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11cbb750e7f84318ac291bd94f2457ecfa8b242c","amp;dn":"Constantine+Pre-Flashpoint","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11cbb750e7f84318ac291bd94f2457ecfa8b242c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,203,183,80,231,248,67,24,172,41,27,217,79,36,87,236,250,139,36,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
