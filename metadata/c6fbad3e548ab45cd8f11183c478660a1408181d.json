However, it soon developed a sizable adult audience as well. The ABC television Space Patrol broadcasts became one of the nation's first mass media phenomena, such that it was quickly moved to an ABC radio series of the same name. The radio program was popular and ran from September 18, 1950 until March 19, 1955 producing approximately 129 thirty-minute episodes.\n\nThis torrent, at 114 episodes, unfortunately does not include the entire series, but is only missing 15 episodes (according to the information on Wikipedia).  I did not name these files, I just compiled them from Internet sources, so some of the names may not be correct (they're close, but not exact).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6fbad3e548ab45cd8f11183c478660a1408181d","amp;dn":"Space+Patrol+%281950s+Radio+Show%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6fbad3e548ab45cd8f11183c478660a1408181d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,251,173,62,84,138,180,92,216,241,17,131,196,120,102,10,20,8,24,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
