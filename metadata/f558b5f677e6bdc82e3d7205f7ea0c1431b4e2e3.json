It was the future. It was exciting and fresh. A musical genre in its infancy that was finding its wayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ learning who it was. It grew up over the yearsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ it evolvedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ still learning about itself. It had a chance to sell out and took it. It embraced the good times and seemed to forget about the important things in life. Eventually it was even used and manipulated by its corporate bosses.\n\nThankfully hip-hopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always had a double life. While the mainstream world thought it was one thing, it managed to keep a connection to the underground and was actually another thing. Unbeknownst to all but true heads, it continued to evolve. Today it exists in the form of the many independent EMCEEs, DJs and producers that continue to embrace it and push it and pull it and prod it and mold it and shape it into new forms that explore its past and its future. To the uninitiated, hip-hop is deadÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“gangstaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“jiggyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about rimsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about hoes &amp; bitchesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uncreativeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stupidÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an embarrassment. Not trueÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ wellÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ only partially trueÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ it is those things and so much more.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s southÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s northÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eastÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s westÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s everything in between. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s malleable and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what makes it so incredible! When done wellÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a thing of beauty. Down in Richmond, VA, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a crew called Just Plain Sounds. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a crew of talented producers, DJs and EMCEEs who are doing it wellÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ making it beautiful. Real music for real souls to feel and connect with. The cast of creators involved in this Joey Ripps album are mostly from RVA, part of the JPS crew who are making good things happen down there. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also 13adluck who makes an appearance on Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Block To Your BlockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ making the team Luck &amp; Ripps a reality once again.\n\nSo I guess what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m saying is that Ã¢â‚¬Å“Son Of 1,000 PardonsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is hip-hop done well. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that stuff that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trying to Ã¢â‚¬Å“keep it realÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ only trying to keep it honest.\n\nThanks once again to JPS for the honest music. Thanks to Joey Ripps, Just Plain Ant, 13adluck, Bliss-One, DJ Harrison, Draztiq, Gordy Micheal, Ohbliv, Rowan &amp; SleazeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an honor.
