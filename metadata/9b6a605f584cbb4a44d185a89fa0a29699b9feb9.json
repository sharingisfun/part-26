There is an iso file, along with the folder that actually contains the application inside of this torrent. \n\n2. The iso might not work for everyone; it does work on my computer though.\n\n3. The reason that this is actually a copy of the install directory is that during install, the installer puts some background programs on your computer that are extremely difficult to remove, and I donÃƒÂ­t want you to have to go through hell to get this thing to work, and not junk up your nice computer\n\n4. The conversions are of great quality, yet not all formats are supported. For any conversion to mp4, I strongly recommend handbrake (search for it).\n\n5. It should be pre-cracked, but if you are having trouble, please consult the ÃƒÂ¬activationÃƒÂ® folder.\n\n6.  IÃƒÂ­m currently in the process of working on an auto installer (copies the files to an appropriate install directory, and activates the software)\n\n   Enjoy, please do seed (I understand that not everyone may have the means to do this, and that is totally fine!)\n\nIf you have any questions about me, my torrents, this torrent, or DMCA information, please send an email to:&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2a48584f444e4b446a48584f444e4b445d43464604444f5e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b6a605f584cbb4a44d185a89fa0a29699b9feb9","amp;dn":"video+converter%2C+movie+converter%2C+FLV+converter%2C+AVI+Converter%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b6a605f584cbb4a44d185a89fa0a29699b9feb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,106,96,95,88,76,187,74,68,209,133,168,159,160,162,150,153,185,254,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
