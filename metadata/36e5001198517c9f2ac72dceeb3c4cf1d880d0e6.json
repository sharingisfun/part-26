Please use the special installer that I have included which will reduce, or completely fix the distorted sound in the game.\n\nI have a previous release on TPB but I've lost my password/email for the account, so I apologize for the repost.\n\n--------\nSYNOPSIS\n--------\n\nBased on RAMA II, by Arrthur C. Clarke and Gentry Lee.\n\nThe year is 2200, and a giant cylindrical structure has appeared on the edge of our solar system.  We call it RAMA.  You are an austronaut who is to replace another who mysteriously died during a routine medical procedure.\n\nExplore this fascinating world, solving puzzles and unearthing a massive controversy.  You will meet other intelligent beings on this structure, but they are asking the same question as you: who are the RAMAN'S, and what is the purpose of RAMA.\n\n----------\nTo Install\n----------\n\n1. Mount disk 1\n2. Run the special installer msi at the root of the torrent\n\t-Alternatively, download installer from http://www.squirtthecat.com/games/rama/index.html\n3. To play, keep disk 1 mounted and run from the start menu, or run SIERW5.exe in the game directory.\n\n-----\nNOTES\n-----\n\nYou will need to mount disc 1 to begin a new game.  Do not unmount the disc, as the game runs heavily on it.  You will need to mount the other discs when you are asked.  The third disc is bonus contnet.\n\nThe walkthrough here will be very useful.  This is a very difficult game: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gameboomers.com/wtcheats/pcRr/rama/part1.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gameboomers.com/wtcheats/pcRr/rama/part1.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpoiler(ish)/Hint (read backwards):\n)8 esab( latco esu sredipsotco ehT  .htam rieht rof )51 esab( lamicedaxeH esu snaivA\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36e5001198517c9f2ac72dceeb3c4cf1d880d0e6","amp;dn":"RAMA+%5BPC%5D+-+zalpha314","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36e5001198517c9f2ac72dceeb3c4cf1d880d0e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,229,0,17,152,81,124,159,42,199,45,206,235,60,76,241,216,128,208,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
