When applications opened almost instantly? With JetDrive you can regain this lost speed.\n\nDefragmentation\n\nThere is a physical reason why your PC slows down with time. The arrangement of files on your hard drive becomes more and more chaotic, and individual files may be broken into many small parts over the entire drive, resulting in fragmentation. The outcome is a slowing down of your system, as the hard drive reads and merges these separate fragments every time you open a file. JetDrive defragments your drive and restores it to an optimal state.\n\nDefragments your RAM\nAlso defragments your Registry because of our special registry defragmentation algorithm.\n\nChecks for harddrive errors\nJetDrive recognizes errors in your hard drives, and can even detect and fix errors automatically if you prefer.\n\nDetailed Reports\nJetDrive creates detailed reports of your hard drive defragmentastion process. It displays the current state in an easy to read 3D view and summarizes all operations.\n\nWhat Does It Do:\n\nDefragments your drives\nDefragments your drives and also particular files. It is also possible to start the defragmentation by a pre-defined time schedule.\n\nDefragments protected Windows-Files\n\nDefragments also files that are protected against any access.\n\nDefragments your Registry\n\nDefragments also your Registry thanks to our special registry defragmentation algorithm.\n\nSupported OS: XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8 (32-bit and 64-bit versions)\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
