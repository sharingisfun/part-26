And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fair to say that the transition from Windows 7 to 8 is as big a step, if not bigger. Be prepared for a surprise. Microsoft has designed Windows 8 from the ground up as an operating system thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s equally at home on a desktop PC, laptop and tablet. It bears an uncanny resemblance to the interfaces of both Windows Phone 7 and Xbox 360. It is, in short, a platform that could be your constant companion from the morning commute to your eveningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entertainment, via a few hoursÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ work in the office or on the move.\nSteve Jobs may have been a little premature in declaring the traditional PC dead, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no secret that an increasing amount of our computing these days takes place on the hoof. There is a a plethora of new computing devices, from smartphones and tablets, to thin-and-light laptops. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a computer for every situation, and the desktop is becoming the odd one out. With Google and Apple taking big bites out of the portable market, Microsoft needs Windows to become a viable mobile and tablet platform.\nImagine files and settings on your laptop at home replicated on your tablet as you travel to work, and accessed again from your office PC. The same information, presented in the same bespoke way on every device. If you are already a Windows user, being able to extend your desktop experience to other screens is a compelling idea, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll agree.\n\nFEATURES\n06 Introduction\n08 History of Windows\n10 8 reasons to upgrade\n12 Minimum specifications\n14 Windows 8 versions\n16 Which version is for you?\n18 Windows and business\n20 Windows 8 on a tablet\n20 Windows 8 on a tablet\n\nNEW FEATURES\n24 Intro\n26 Modern UI\n32 Windows Store\n34 Navigation by touch\n36 Charms\n38 Snap multi-tasking\n40 Native USB 3.0 support\n42 Virtual keyboard\n44 Sync your settings\n46 More PC settings\n48 Exploring ribbons\n\nTUTORIALS\n50 Intro Windows 8\n52 Install Windows 8\n54 Social media\n56 Sharing with SkyDrive\n58 Set up email with Mail app\n60 Access a PC remotely\n62 Bing Maps\n64 Secure Windows 8\n66 Install Windows 8 on a Mac\n68 Custom shortcuts\n\nAPP REVIEWS\n70 Intro\n72 Ashampoo ImageFX\n73 Autodesk SketchBook Express\n74 Bing Finance\n75 Bing Weather\n76 Docstoc\n77 Endomondo\n78 Flow\n79 Grantophone\n80 iCookbook\n81 Kobo eReader\n82 MusiXmatch\n83 News Republic\n84 Photobucket\n85 Physamajig\n86 SlapDash Podcasts\n87 Vimeo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fbdc27e489f78b72ce6aa262cbb9acd367c31f8","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Guide+to+Windows+8+%282013+update%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fbdc27e489f78b72ce6aa262cbb9acd367c31f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,189,194,126,72,159,120,183,44,230,170,38,44,187,154,205,54,124,49,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
