After a string of introspective albums, the old\n-school (as in Ben Folds Five era) &quot;Hiroshima (B B B Benny Hit His\nHead),&quot; with its bombastic strings, &quot;Benny and the Jets&quot;-inspired\npiano motif and not-so-subtle refrain of &quot;They're watching me,\nwatching me fall&quot; marks a return to the snarky, sarcastic days of\nold when Folds' signature blend of nerdy bravado and apathetic\nmelodiousness wrested dominance of the proverbial cheap, college\ndorm stereo from They Might Be Giants. Like all of Folds' records,\nWay to Normal is full of melodic hooks and witty, semi-obvious\nbarbs. Folds rarely works in metaphor, so when he sings, &quot;The\nbitch went nuts/she stabbed my basketball and the speakers to my\nstereo,&quot; that's really all that happened. Surprisingly, it's the\nquieter moments on Way to Normal like &quot;Cologne,&quot; &quot;Kylie from\nConnecticut,&quot; and to a lesser extent &quot;You Don't Know Me&quot; (the\nlatter, a duet with Regina Spektor) that elicit the biggest\nthrills, but they're few and far between. Folds has always found a\nway to balance all of the privileged, rich-kid prickishness with\nmoments of surprising profundity, but this time around the\nprofanity and outrage feel more forced than usual -- the\naforementioned &quot;Bitch Went Nuts&quot; feels somehow more sophomoric\ncoming from the mouth of a 42-year-old producer, composer, and\nfather. Way to Normal may win a few fans back who balked at the\nnewfound sincerity that peppered his last two or three records,\nbut a little more nuance and a lot less displaced teen angst would\nhave made it palatable for everybody. [Folds reissued Way to\nNormal in 2009 as a two-disc set called Stems and Seeds. Disc one\nfeatured the remixed, remastered, re-sequenced album in its'\nentirety, though without the excessive, radio-ready compression\nthat accompanies most major label releases, while disc two\nfeatured files from the sessions that listeners could upload to\n&quot;Garageband&quot; and remix themselves.]\n\ndid not include disc2 because it's garageband files.\n\nenjoy..\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d5eda934207c0f6e4411150d8c2076e500da0f8","amp;dn":"Ben_Folds-Stems_And_Seeds-2009-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d5eda934207c0f6e4411150d8c2076e500da0f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,94,218,147,66,7,192,246,228,65,17,80,216,194,7,110,80,13,160,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
