This resource now includes over 1,050 tutorial questions/answers and a new &quot;Final Review and Last Minute Super Review Boot Camp&quot; section. This guide is an ideal review tool for state licensing, the NCC credential, and preparation for written and oral boards. And because the new Counselor Preparation Comprehensive Examination (CPCE), draws from the same subject areas, the Encyclopedia is a perfect study guide for the CPCE as well. Written in a unique question/answer format, with a quick reference index, this is also an essential student reference volume for use in any counseling, social work, or human services course.\n\n\n\n\nProduct Details\nPaperback: 672 pages\nPublisher: Routledge; 3 edition (December 17, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0415958628\nISBN-13: 978-0415958622\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70b6e3309f231bdc6f5552ffd43774f464b4e123","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Counseling%3A+Master+Review+and+Tutorial+for+the+N","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70b6e3309f231bdc6f5552ffd43774f464b4e123","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,182,227,48,159,35,27,220,111,85,82,255,212,55,116,244,100,180,225,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
