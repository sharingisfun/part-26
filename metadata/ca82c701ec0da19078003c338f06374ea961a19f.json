Lesh, Helen M. Doerr : Beyond Constructivism: Models and Modeling Perspectives on Mathematics Problem Solving, Learning, and Teaching\nPages: 331 | PDF | Lawrence Erlbaum (2003-05-01) | ISBN 080583821X\n\nThis book has two primary goals. On the level of theory development, the book clarifies the nature of an emerging &quot;models and modeling perspective&quot; about teaching, learning, and problem solving in mathematics and science education. On the level of emphasizing practical problems, it clarifies the nature of some of the most important elementary-but-powerful mathematical or scientific understandings and abilities that Americans are likely to need as foundations for success in the present and future technology-based information age.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca82c701ec0da19078003c338f06374ea961a19f","amp;dn":"Beyond+Constructivism+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca82c701ec0da19078003c338f06374ea961a19f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,130,199,1,236,13,161,144,120,0,60,51,143,6,55,78,169,97,161,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
