The network takes railway travel time between Chengdu and Chongqing down from 10 hours on the previous railway to just one hour! The network also connects Suining, Nanchong, GuangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢an and other major cities.\n\nThe network is built to Chinese high speed railway standards and trains on the route are capable of running up to 350 km/h. The fastest train, the CRH380 Series, takes only 57 mins to finish the journey between Chengdu and Chongqing.\n\nThe network is equipped with the CTCS-3 (China Train Control System) signalling system and both 350km/h and 250km/h trains can run on this route.\n\nThe network features 22 stations and this package for Train Simulator also includes the CRH1A EMU (Electro Motive Unit) that is designed for commuter use at the stations along the route. This unit is capable of running at 250 km/h (155 mph) but in normal service runs at 220 km/h (137 mph). The CRH1A also includes the CTCS-3 signalling system.\n\n12 Standard and four Free Roam scenarios are included to allow you to fly at high speed on the ground and enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Sichuan Basin area.\n\nCurrently the fastest route for Train Simulator\n22 stations\nBuilt using Chinese high speed rail standards\nIncludes more than 150 Chinese-featured objects for the route\nCTCS-3 signalling system for both 250km/h and 350km/h trains\nBeautiful detailed scenery in Sichuan Basin area\n12 Standard and four Free Roam scenarios included\nCRH1A EMU included\nRoute is Quick drive enabled","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47f5f2aac9234fdbf6c0b3b2d72a538a86bfb6c0","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+Just+Trains+Southwest+China+High+Speed+Rail+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47f5f2aac9234fdbf6c0b3b2d72a538a86bfb6c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,245,242,170,201,35,79,219,246,192,179,178,215,42,83,138,134,191,182,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
