Barker plays Pinkerton man Jeff Carr, who comes to the town of Tomahawk in search of a gang of stage robbers. The consensus of opinion is that sheepman Alec Black (Stephen McNally) is responsible for the holdups, but Carr senses a frame-up. Sure enough, the real villains are in the employ of would-be frontier dictator Ranse Jackman (John Dehner). Carr knows this, the audience knows this; but how to get the goods on Jackman? Mara Cordy costars as female sheep farmer Holly Kenton, the heroine of the piece.\nJack Arnold didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make many Westerns, but when he did, the results were terrific (Red Sundown, No Name On The Bullet). The Man From Bitter Ridge (1955) was his first. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got one of those great mid-50s Universal-International casts: Lex Barker, Mara Corday, Stephen McNally, John Dehner, Ray Teal and Warren Stevens.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.17gb\nDuration.... 01:16:56\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 704\nFrame Height.... 384\nData Rate.... 1089kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 192kbps....
