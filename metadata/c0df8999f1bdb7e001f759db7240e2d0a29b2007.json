Eleven different types are described, with a\r\nshort preview on the early aircraft in service, many of which continued to fly on second-line duties, followed by a photo-section dealing with a handful of prototypes which had flown but failed to reach operational status by the end of the war.\r\n\r\nThe essence of the Aeroplane Collectorsâ€™ Archive is to present each aircraft as a photo-essay supported by text and informative captions. As with other books in this series many of the illustrations come from the extensive archive held by The Aeroplane, but to provide a wider coverage of each type some of the pictures originate from wartime German sources.\r\n\r\nAdding to the informative nature of the series, cutaway drawings are included, some of which were produced by the skillful British illustrators working for the Air Intelligence Branch of the Air Ministry, often gleaning the intricacies of each type by crawling over wrecks and captured examples to find out the latest in German\r\naviation design. Acknowledgement is also due to Flightâ€™s wartime artist, Max Millar, and to John Weal, an outstanding technical illustrator of more recent times whose work also graces this publication","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0df8999f1bdb7e001f759db7240e2d0a29b2007","amp;dn":"German+Bombers+of+WWII+%28Aviation+Archive%29+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0df8999f1bdb7e001f759db7240e2d0a29b2007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,223,137,153,241,189,183,224,1,247,89,219,114,64,226,208,162,155,32,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
