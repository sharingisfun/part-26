Beginning his piano studies at age six, by 13 he was touring with his mother, aunt Anna, and his sister Martha in a group billed as the McGarrigle Sisters and Family; a year later, Wainwright was nominated for a Juno (the Canadian equivalent of a Grammy) as Most Promising Young Artist, while his &quot;I'm A-Runnin'&quot; was concurrently nominated for a Genie (the Canadian counterpart to an Oscar) for Best Song in a Film. \n\nArtist...............: Rufus Wainwright\nAlbum................: Vibrate: The Best Of Rufus Wainwright (Deluxe Edition)\nGenre................: Pop\nSource...............: CD {Interscope/Geffen B001991402}\nYear.................: 2014\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20071117\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 60 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: NMR\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 3/11/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: LOG, CUE, AUDIOCHECKER\nCovers...............: Front Back CD \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       CD1\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
