Basing himself on &quot;The Aspiration of Samantabhadra&quot;, a proclamation in the Buddhist tantras of the Buddha Samantabhadra, Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche illuminates the philosophy and meditation practices of Dzogchen, the highest and most profound teaching of all of Tibetan Buddhism. With precision that does not intimidate the uninitiated, Rinpoche explains the basic nature of our very own mind - complete enlightenment - and how we may go about making this nature of mind manifest through making profound aspirations and through relying on the skillful methods of the Vajrayana, Tibetan Buddhism's &quot;indestructible&quot; path of insight.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2c4370305eb6e19a1ccbb4ec106dba94711cd4c","amp;dn":"Penetrating+Wisdom+-+The+Aspiration+of+Samantabhadra+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2c4370305eb6e19a1ccbb4ec106dba94711cd4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,196,55,3,5,235,110,25,161,204,187,78,193,6,219,169,71,17,205,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
