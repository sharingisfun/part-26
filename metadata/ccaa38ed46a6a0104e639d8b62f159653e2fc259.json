That release was followed in 2003 by SampleTank 2, which has since become an industry standard with an unparalleled software longevity due to its high-quality sounds, easy-to-use interface and powerful included effects. Considering its versatility and power, it's no wonder that SampleTank has been featured on thousands of the most iconic productions and compositions of the last decade.\n\nNow, over ten years in the making, SampleTank 3 builds on this storied heritage. Like its predecessors, it's the most advanced sound workstation available on the market today with a whole new world of sounds, advanced playing and editing features and a full suite of studio-quality effects. SampleTank 3 builds on the features that have made it one of the most popular virtual instruments of all time making it an essential piece in the musical toolkit of any serious musician, studio producer or live performer for years to come.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\n\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\n\nREVERSE 2 REVOLUTiONiZE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nthepiratebay.se - 1337x.to - flashtorrents.org - fenopy.se\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (08).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccaa38ed46a6a0104e639d8b62f159653e2fc259","amp;dn":"IK+Multimedia+-+SampleTank+3+v3.0.2+OS+X+%5BR2R%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccaa38ed46a6a0104e639d8b62f159653e2fc259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,170,56,237,70,166,160,16,78,99,157,139,98,241,89,101,62,47,194,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
