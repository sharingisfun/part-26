Get it here!\n\nIt's suitable for anyone - if you've never tried DF before, or played for years - because while I've set up all the included parts already, the core is as easily accessible to you:  you can add, remove, update, replace whatever you want to and customise the pack as much as you want.  The tools I've included make the game easier to get into, but avoid changing any of the fundamentals - there are no mods here.  Dwarf Fortress can be confusing enough to play, but doesn't need to be hard to set up too.\n\nChangelog:\n - fixed 'Extras' installation; no effect but cleaner\n - added DFHack 40_10-r1\n - enabled Falconne's UI plugins\n - re-add DFHack tab in the launcher\n\nMD5: C0C8E8D82DA0A5FC0805E50EC5D20680","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:340be61d2181c1abcece913d04d09e1ea9651b78","amp;dn":"Dwarf+Fortress+40_10+Starter+Pack+r2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"340be61d2181c1abcece913d04d09e1ea9651b78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,11,230,29,33,129,193,171,206,206,145,61,4,208,158,30,169,101,27,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
