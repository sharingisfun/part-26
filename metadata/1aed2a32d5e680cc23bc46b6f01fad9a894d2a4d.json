A recommended set with plenty of excellent music, it serves as a fine overview of Cannonball Adderley's career'.&quot;\n\n------\nTrack listing\n\nAll compositions by Adderley except as indicated\n\n    &quot;Hi-Fly&quot; (Randy Weston) - 6:04\n    &quot;Work Song&quot; (Nat Adderley) - 6:28\n    &quot;Sack O' Woe&quot; - 5:06\n    &quot;Jive Samba&quot; (Nat Adderley) - 5:19\n    &quot;This Here&quot; (Bobby Timmons) - 7:12\n    &quot;The Sidewalks of New York&quot; (James W.
