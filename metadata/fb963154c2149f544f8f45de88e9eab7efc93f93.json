This means the game will be improved on a regular basis, so be sure to check back for new updates. \nRight now, KSP is in Alpha state, but we want you to try it out and have fun with it. The first versions are free to download and play, and will remain so forever.\n\nEnjoy the game, and as always, buy it from the website if you want.\n\nIt's quite hard too. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb963154c2149f544f8f45de88e9eab7efc93f93","amp;dn":"KSP+-+Kerbal+Space+Program+-+0.15","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb963154c2149f544f8f45de88e9eab7efc93f93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,150,49,84,194,20,159,84,79,143,69,222,136,233,234,183,239,201,63,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
