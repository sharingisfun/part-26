It's up to you to lead them to safety by placing tiles and power ups in their way. \n\nIt has 72 levels split across three distinctive worlds, where players must simultaneously save the Hairys from falling off the edge of the world by re-arranging the tiles on each level, while acquiring power ups, magic mushrooms and destroying evil enemy Kikimoras and their three powerful end bosses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:649d6187009c2f6729f9a4629067305cc6310163","amp;dn":"Hairy+Tales","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"649d6187009c2f6729f9a4629067305cc6310163","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,157,97,135,0,156,47,103,41,249,164,98,144,103,48,92,198,49,1,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
