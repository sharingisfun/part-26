Then we'll set up our level assets that will fit our needs based on the level sketches.\n\nOnce we have our basic assets built, we'll dive into bringing our character to life through the power of scripting. We'll tackle how to make the character move, jump, double jump and attack. After scripting the character movement, we'll look at how to create a unique health system and a classic camera setup.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f39228864880be209c73a550e8a00614e5b5102a","amp;dn":"Indie+Game+Dev+Pipeline+Vol+2+Character+Prototyping+DigitalTutor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f39228864880be209c73a550e8a00614e5b5102a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,146,40,134,72,128,190,32,156,115,165,80,232,160,6,20,229,181,16,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
