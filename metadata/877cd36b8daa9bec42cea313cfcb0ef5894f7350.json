It began as a duo between Joey Belville and Aaron Bowman in 1992, and has since released eleven major albums.\n\nWhile founder Belville is a devout Christian, it is difficult to apply the same label to the band itself. While the lyrics are at times clearly infused with a strong element of faith, they are not specifically based around praise. Christian artists also make occasional appearances. For instance, Riki Michele provided vocals on &quot;Defend Your Joy&quot;, though she was uncredited for the part.\n\nA remix of the song &quot;Oxygen&quot; from Hope Springs Eternal appeared on the Sci-Fi Channel's show First Wave.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - October 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:877cd36b8daa9bec42cea313cfcb0ef5894f7350","amp;dn":"The+Echoing+Green+Discography+1997-2011+%287+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"877cd36b8daa9bec42cea313cfcb0ef5894f7350","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,124,211,107,141,170,155,236,66,206,163,19,207,203,14,245,137,79,115,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
