It&amp;#039;s funk, fusion, jazz - with healthy doses of rock and blues. The great thing about the band on this album is that they&amp;#039;re all very good at their respective instruments. Of course we all know that Beck is going to be great, but it&amp;#039;s surprising when fellow band members can equal the equivalent of his talent on their own instruments. This is, in my opinion, Beck&amp;#039;s best album - and in saying that I mean one that showcases his versatility and intelligent playing. All these songs sound like jams, but they don&amp;#039;t have the rawness or &amp;#039;rough areas&amp;#039; of jams - wow.&quot;\n\n&quot;I bought this recently on the strength of reviews here having never heard it before, though I have had Beck Ola and Truth since they came out as LPs, and have personally seen the Jeff Beck band in performance with lead singer Rod Stewart. I was not disappointed. This is a truly wonderful and totally original album of instrumental jazz rock fusion that really succeeds in carrying it off. Anyway, I&amp;#039;m not going to comment track by track, and all I&amp;#039;m going to say is that this is a superb album.&quot;\n\nBreezin Says: The Best Instrumental Guitar Album Ever.
