DavisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ fourth solo piano recording, and this time he dives head first into the heavy side of his musical personality.  The album features DavisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ own arrangements of classic Metallica tunes from their albums &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; (1984) through &quot;Load&quot; (1996).\n\nWhile the concept of a tribute album is nothing new, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s something that can often backfire.  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI knew I was on dangerous ground when I decided to tackle this album.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Davis.  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI realized that a number of ingredients would have to be just right if this was going to work.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  As someone whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been playing air guitar to MetallicaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songs for years, he let his love and respect for the original performances guide the process.  He devoted himself to faultlessly following every nuance of James HetfieldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocal melodies, capturing the moodiness and intensity of the guitar riffs, and making sure that Kirk HammettÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s blazing fast guitar solos stay, well, blazing fast.  Even so, bringing it to life on the piano still demanded a lot of creativity.  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI was constantly having to change it to keep it the same.  ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s like an oxymoron; stay true to the original, and still make it uniquely your own.  It can be very elusive, but when you find that balance, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a beautiful thing.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe intricate arrangements and dynamic passages of MetallicaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performances share much in common with classical music, which makes for surprisingly good piano music. Songs like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Nothing Else MattersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Fade to BlackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ already have such a beautiful, classical quality, that they seem almost meant for the piano.  But Metallica is famous for being heavy and hard-hitting.  According to Davis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMetallicaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s genius is that the know when to get soft and melodic, so thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s contrast between loud and soft, slow and fast.  Music thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s loud and fast all the time, becomes tiring.  Ironically, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the soft sections that give their music so much power, and set Metallica apart from other metal bands.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe initial idea for &quot;Pianotarium&quot; came years earlier. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been a die-hard Metallica fan since I first heard Master of Puppets when I was 16ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Davis.  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt was around that time that I first started learning to play the keyboard. I remember trying to mess around with some of their songs on my little Casio keyboard, but their music was way to difficult for a beginner, plus the idea just seemed crazy.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAs a piano player who also loves heavy metal music, Davis has always felt a sense of musical schizophrenia.  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be on my way to one of my concerts, where the audience is coming to hear some beautiful and relaxing new age piano playing, and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m head banging to thrash metalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Says Scott.  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAnd IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d often ask myself ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“How many people in my audience would be horrified to know what IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m listening to right nowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThis is not DavisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ first solo piano rock tribute album.  In 2005 he released &quot;Rockfluence,&quot; a collection of songs from his favorite rock and metal groups, which includes songs by the Eagles, Led Zeppelin, Linkin Park, and even one Metallica song.  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI was testing the rock tribute waters with Rockfluence.  I wanted to prove whether or not I could do it.  So now, I finally felt ready to take on the mother of all hard rock tributes, a solo piano tribute to the metal gods themselves, Metallica.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efde9eacdd4629edc6767447f9d9b74ff0daca2a","amp;dn":"Pianotarium++-+A+Piano+Tribute+To+Metallica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efde9eacdd4629edc6767447f9d9b74ff0daca2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,222,158,172,221,70,41,237,198,118,116,71,249,217,183,79,240,218,202,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
