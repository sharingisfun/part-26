These late works from the Pratyabhijna tradition of monistic and tantric Kashmiri Saiva philosophy focus on means to deindividualize and disclose the primordial, divine essential natures of the human ego and body-sense.\n\nDavid Peter Lawrence situates these writings in their medieval, South Asian religious and intellectual contexts. He goes on to engage Pratyabhijna philosophical psychology in dialogue with Western religious and psychoanalytic conceptions of identity and &quot;narcissism,&quot; and also demonstrates the Saiva tradition's strong concern with ethics. The richly annotated translation and glossary illuminate the texts for all readers.\n\nPaperback: 210 pages\nPublisher: State University of New York Press (July 1, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0791475549\nISBN-13: 978-0791475546\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
