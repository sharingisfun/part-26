The raging waters not only sweep away Donovan but also fellow prisoner Peebles, and guard Sharkey, who was supervising them. The trio wash up at the flooded farmhouse of Dr. Matthews who is away attending victims at a crisis center. At first the three survivors think the house is abandoned until Elizabeth, the doctor's daughter, appears and the tension begins.\r\n\r\nHoward Keel recalled the filming in his autobiography: &quot;All the flood scenes were filmed on one of the large stages at Pinewood Studios. The water had to be both dirty and cold, and it was. They couldn't heat it for fear it might get rancid. Anne Heywood never once protested about the water. Cyril Cusack and I were good friends. We had a little contest over Anne. He was a real cutie, as well as a hell of an actor, but I won out.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 480x368, 25.000 fps, 1076 Kbps, 01h20m47s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\r\n\r\nTVRip with faint corner logo\r\n\r\nDUAL Audio Tracks English and Spanish, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/f239b9ol7/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/f60nrkmb7/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/8r1muwflf/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/e16lm6zub/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/x4zx2jcoj/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dcadd99778287f44346638229ea39c18b3b07aa","amp;dn":"Floods+of+Fear+%281958+-+United+Kingdom%29+action+adventure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dcadd99778287f44346638229ea39c18b3b07aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,202,221,153,119,130,135,244,67,70,99,130,41,234,57,193,139,59,7,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
