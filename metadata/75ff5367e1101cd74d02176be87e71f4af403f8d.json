But when sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s asked to pose in a photo shoot for the Hot Ink tattoo studio, she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say no. She finally gets a look at EricÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tattoos when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re cajoled into posing together, and in a few breathtaking moments, an on-camera kiss turns the passion theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re asked to fake into something very real, leaving them both wanting more. The only problem is that MinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the glamour girl she looks like on the Hot Ink posters, or even in a tattoo magazine. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only twenty-four, but being the sole guardian of her disabled younger sister has left her feeling much older. Will Eric still be interested when he gets to know the girl behind the ink and the make-up and finds out that she and her little sister are a package deal?\n\nInnocent Ink (Inked in the Steel City #2) by Ranae Rose (May 27th 2013)\n\nPhotographing exceptional tattoos for the Hot Ink Tattoo Studio turns into much more than just a job when Karen meets Jed, the sexy-as-sin owner. With attraction sizzling between them, each photo shoot is a labor of love Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and a chance to get closer to the man of her increasingly naughty dreams.\n\nCurvy, vivacious Karen is everything Jed would want in a woman, if he wanted one at all. But a relationship seems like too dangerous a gamble for someone whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loved before and suffered the ultimate loss. So why canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t he resist when he discovers the attraction is mutual? Even if he were willing to risk everything again, KarenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too young, too full of life to be burdened with someone whose heart bears scars as permanent as the ink in his skin.\n\nWhen the two finally face what lies between them, the passion is undeniably real, but will the unexpected extinguish the spark of their love, or fan the flames?\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75ff5367e1101cd74d02176be87e71f4af403f8d","amp;dn":"Inked+In+The+Steel+City+Series+%281-2%29+by+Ranae+Rose+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75ff5367e1101cd74d02176be87e71f4af403f8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,255,83,103,225,16,28,215,77,2,23,107,232,126,113,244,175,64,63,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
