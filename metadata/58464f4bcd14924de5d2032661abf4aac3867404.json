A personal, and at times provocative look at life in France following the Charlie Hebdo terror attacks.\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/07/20/88db96a56001949e4a3fbd0c9e2b9590.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/07/20/7ff46f7b6cf9a582cfe0e3b526697835.jpg[/img]\n\nWhen gunmen shot dead 12 people in the attacks on Charlie Hebdo magazine, the hashtag 'Je Suis Charlie' seemed to unify France. But for many young Muslims it was a symbol of their growing alienation from mainstream French society, where the right-wing Front Nationale are now the leading party for the under-35s.\n\nBritish journalist and comedian Shaista Aziz travels to our nearest neighbour to find out why the country has become so divided. As France reels from attacks carried out by French Muslim extremists, she meets the ordinary young Muslims who feel rejected by their country, with some even hiding their Muslim identity to get work.\n\nShaista confronts the far-right youth organisations who believe foreigners should be repatriated. In a rare interview, she speaks to Dieudonne, the controversial comedian who talks about what he calls the double standards over free speech that exist in France today","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58464f4bcd14924de5d2032661abf4aac3867404","amp;dn":"A+Nation+Divided+The+Charlie+Hebdo+Aftermath+WEBRIP+%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58464f4bcd14924de5d2032661abf4aac3867404","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,70,79,75,205,20,146,77,229,210,3,38,97,171,244,170,195,134,116,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
