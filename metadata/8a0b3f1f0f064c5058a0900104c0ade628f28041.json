The main character, Turner, is an anthropomorphic rebel bunny rabbit with impressive combat skills. In his quest to find those responsible for slaughtering his village, he uncovers a far-reaching conspiracy involving the corrupt leaders of the rabbit republic and the starving wolves from a nearby den. Turner takes it upon himself to fight against their plot and save his fellow rabbits from slavery.\nLugaru?s primary feature is its unique combat system. Instead of relying on confusing button combinations to perform moves, Lugaru?s moves are all logical and context sensitive. For example, if an opponent aims a roundhouse kick at Turner?s head, you can crouch and then stand up under the attack to grab your assailant?s leg and kick him away. If you try and punch an opponent and he tries to throw you over his shoulder, you can crouch to roll painlessly out of the throw. This new combat system makes fights look and feel much more intense and believable than in any other game. You can see it in action with the gameplay movies above.\n\nKeygen is clean \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/9d5cc289fdacb997f810360b111d3e39&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/9d5cc289fdacb997f810360b111d3e39&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a0b3f1f0f064c5058a0900104c0ade628f28041","amp;dn":"Lugaru+1.05+plus+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a0b3f1f0f064c5058a0900104c0ade628f28041","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,11,63,31,15,6,76,80,88,160,144,1,4,192,173,230,40,242,128,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
