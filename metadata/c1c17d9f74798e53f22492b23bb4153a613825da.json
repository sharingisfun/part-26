However, if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re modeling databases to run on Microsoft SQL Server 2008 or 2005, theoretical or platform-agnostic data modeling knowledge isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t enough: models that donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t reflect SQL ServerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique real-world strengths and weaknesses often lead to disastrous performance.\n\nA DeveloperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Guide to Data Modeling for SQL Server is a practical, SQL Server-specific guide to data modeling for every developer, architect, and administrator. This book offers you invaluable start-to-finish guidance for designing new databases, redesigning existing SQL Server data models, and migrating databases from other platforms.\n\nYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll begin with a concise, practical overview of the core data modeling techniques. Next, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll walk through requirements gathering and discover how to convert requirements into effective SQL Server logical models. Finally, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll systematically transform those logical models into physical models that make the most of SQL ServerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s extended functionality. All of this bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s many examples are available for download from a companion Web site.\n\nThis book enables you to\n\n* Understand your data modelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s physical elements, from storage to referential integrity\n* Provide programmability via stored procedures, user-defined functions, triggers, and .NET CLR integration\n* Normalize data models, one step at a time\n* Gather and interpret requirements more effectively\n* Learn an effective methodology for creating logical models\n* Overcome modeling problems related to entities, attribute, data types, storage overhead, performance, and relationships\n* Create physical modelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from establishing naming guidelines through implementing business rules and constraints\n* Use SQL ServerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique indexing capabilities, and overcome their limitations\n* Create abstraction layers that enhance security, extensibility, and flexibility","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1c17d9f74798e53f22492b23bb4153a613825da","amp;dn":"Covering+SQL+Server+2005+and+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1c17d9f74798e53f22492b23bb4153a613825da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,193,125,159,116,121,142,83,242,36,146,178,59,180,21,58,97,56,37,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
