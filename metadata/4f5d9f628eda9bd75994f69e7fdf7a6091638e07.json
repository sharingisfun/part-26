It was recorded on October 17, 1988 at the Salle Pleyel, in Paris, France in front of a live audience.\n\nThe first track on the album is simply entitled &quot;October 17, 1988,&quot; named after the day of the concert. It is one of Jarrett's unpremeditated solo works; a 38 minute-long improvisation without pause. The first 7 to 8 minutes is a very dark, classically influenced, almost chorale-like ostinato in C minor, very reminiscent of a church hymn played on an organ. After leaving this melodic development, Jarrett plays a repeated bass vamp in his left hand that has almost a rock-ish feel to it, and in his right hand he improvises some very intense, almost sinister lines allluding to F minor and B-flat minor. After resolving again with the slow Baroque-esque themes again, he concludes. The second track, a ballad by American jazz composers Russ Freeman and Jerry Gladstone entitled &quot;The Wind,&quot;, is relatively brief at just over six minutes long; Jarrett uses much of his classical training and technique to embellish the lyrical melody. Finally, the third track is another shorter piece, an improvised C major blues, played in a sultry, slow New Orleans &quot;street beat&quot; style.\n\nThe album was first released on November 26, 1990. It was also one of Jarrett's last solo piano efforts before his problems with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img103.imageshack.us/img103/2870/301600600wl0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img103.imageshack.us/img103/2870/301600600wl0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1.
