BallardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work are discussed, Crash and Empire of the Sun are always mentioned but never Jonathan WeissÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Atrocity Exhibition. Now, thanks to the Dutch film company Reel 23, we can see what Weiss was up to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve recently released this buried work on DVD (and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a beautiful piece of packaging, too, filled with cut-up imagery and a revealing essay on the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s genesis from Weiss himself).\n\nAccording to Fright Site, the film ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwas shot over a two-year period in a number of disparate locations, from junkyards to abandoned military installations to the Philadelphia Museum of Modern Art. It was initially completed in 1997, but reedited from a near two-hour running time down to 105 minutes for screenings at the 1999 Slamdance and 2000 Seattle Film FestivalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.
