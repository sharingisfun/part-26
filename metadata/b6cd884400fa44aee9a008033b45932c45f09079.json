It provides the essential conceptual and methodological tools to approach nano-research issues. The authorsâ€™ expertise in colloid science will contribute to the understanding of basic issues involved in research. Each chapter covers a classical subject of colloid science, in simple and straightforward terms, and addresses its relevance to nanoscience before introducing case studies.\r\n\r\n\r\nGathers in a single volume the information currently scattered across various sources\r\nStraightforward introduction of theoretical concepts and in-depth case studies help you understand molecular mechanisms and master advanced techniques\r\nIncludes chapter on self-assembly as an alternative to nanostructured phases\r\nIncludes examples showing applications of classical concepts to real-world cutting-edge research","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6cd884400fa44aee9a008033b45932c45f09079","amp;dn":"Colloidal+Foundations+of+Nanoscience","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6cd884400fa44aee9a008033b45932c45f09079","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,205,136,68,0,250,68,174,233,160,8,3,59,69,147,44,69,240,144,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
