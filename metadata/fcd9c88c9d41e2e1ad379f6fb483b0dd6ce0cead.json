This chilling collection of true-crime tales dating from the mid-eighteenth century to the present day all feature some element of the paranormal. Gathered from across the UK, cases include the discovery of a body by a spiritual medium, a murder solved by a dream of the mother of the victim, and evidence at a Scottish murder trial provided by the ghost of the victim himself. Featuring visions, psychometry, ghosts, haunted prisons, possessions, and spiritual detectives, this book is a fascinating look at criminology and ghost hunting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcd9c88c9d41e2e1ad379f6fb483b0dd6ce0cead","amp;dn":"Paul+Adams+-+Ghosts+%26amp%3B+Gallows.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcd9c88c9d41e2e1ad379f6fb483b0dd6ce0cead","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,217,200,140,157,65,226,225,173,55,159,111,180,131,176,221,108,224,206,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
