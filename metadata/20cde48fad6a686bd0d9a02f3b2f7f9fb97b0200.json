I'M JUST CHANGING THE NAME SO ALL SHOW TITLES ARE FORMATTED ALIKE.\n\n&quot;I'm Casey Kasem counting 'em down to number one.&quot;\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nThere have been three songs in the rock era titled, &quot;Without You&quot; (one is at number 24 by Franke &amp; The Knockouts). Casey plays samples of the other two.\n\nThere was only one time in the history of Warner Brothers where they signed on a band on the basis of an audition tape they got in the mail and nothing else. Casey plays one of their songs as an in-show extra.\n\nCasey tells about the fantastic career of music producer Chips Momen.\n\nThe most successful singer/songwriter in the history of the charts finally makes number one on the soul chart after 18 years.\n\nLw#3: I've Never Been To Me - Charlene\nLw#2: Don't Talk To Strangers - Rick Springfield\nLw#1: Ebony &amp; Ivory - Paul McCartney &amp; Stevie Wonder\n40:    Hope You Love Me Like You Say You Do - Huey Lewis &amp; The News\n39:    Murphy's Law - Cheri\n38:    Friends In Love - Dionne Warwick And Johnny Mathis        \n37:    After The Glitter Fades - Stevie Nicks     \n36:    Personally - Karla Bonoff     \n35:    I Don't Know Where To Start - Eddie Rabbitt    \n34:    Still They Ride - Journey\n33:    Forget Me Nots - Patrice Rushen\n32:    Fantasy - Aldo Nova\n31:    Break It Up - Foreigner\n30:    When He Shines - Sheena Easton\n29:    Only The Lonely - The Motels    \n28:    Play The Game Tonight - Kansas\n27:    Take Me Down - Alabama\nLdd: Being With You - Smokey Robinson\n26:    When It's Over - Loverboy\n25:    Any Day Now - Ronnie Milsap\n24:    Without You - Franke &amp; The Knockouts\n23:    Run For The Roses - Dan Fogelberg\n22:    Did It In A Minute - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n21:    Tainted Love - Soft Cell\n20:    Caught Up In You - .38 Special\n19:    Empty Garden - Elton John\n18:    '65 Love Affair - Paul Davis\nExtra: Listen To The Music - The Doobie Brothers\n17:    Hurts So Good - John Cougar\n16:    Let It Whip - Dazz Band\n15:    Love's Been A Little Bit Hard On Me - Juice Newton\n14:    Man On Your Mind - The Little River Band\n13:    Making Love - Roberta Flack\n12:    Body Language - Queen\n11/Ldd:    I've Never Been To Me - Charlene\n10:    It's Gonna Take A Miracle - Deniece Williams\n9:    867-5309/Jenny - Tommy Tutone\n8:    Crimson And Clover - Joan Jett &amp; The Blackhearts\n7:    Rosanna - Toto\n6:    Heat Of The Moment - Asia\n5:    Always On My Mind - Willie Nelson\n4:    The Other Woman - Ray Parker Jr.\nExtra: The Rubber Band Man - The Spinners\n3:    Don't You Want Me - The Human League\n2:    Don't Talk To Strangers - Rick Springfield\n1:    Ebony &amp; Ivory - Paul McCartney &amp; Stevie Wonder\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20cde48fad6a686bd0d9a02f3b2f7f9fb97b0200","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1982_June_12th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20cde48fad6a686bd0d9a02f3b2f7f9fb97b0200","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,205,228,143,173,106,104,107,208,217,160,47,59,47,127,159,185,123,2,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
