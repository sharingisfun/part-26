Olivia Townsend is nothing special. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a girl working her way through college so she can return home to help her father run his business. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined not to be the second woman in his life to abandon him, even if it means putting her own life on hold. To Olivia, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear what she must do. Plain and simple. Black and white. But clear becomes complicated when she meets Cash and Nash Davenport. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re brothers. Twins. \n\nCash is everything sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always wanted in a guy. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a dangerous, sexy bad boy who wants her in his bed at any cost. He turns her insides to mush and, with just one kiss, makes her forget why heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no good for her. Nash is everything sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever needed in a guy. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s successful, responsible and intensely passionate. But heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taken. Very taken, by none other than Marissa, LivÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rich, beautiful cousin. That doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop Olivia from melting every time he looks at her, though. With just one touch, he makes her forget why they can never be together. \n\nBlack and white turns to shades of gray when Olivia discovers the boys are hiding something, something that should make her run as far and as fast as she can. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late to run. OliviaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already involved. And in love. With both of them. Both brothers make her heart tremble. Both brothers set her body on fire. She wants them both. And they want her. How will she ever choose between them?\n\nUp to Me  (The Bad Boys #2)\nFor Olivia, romantic bliss has never felt so right as it does with Cash. Unpredictable, except when it comes to satisfying her desires, CashÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¯Â¿Â½bad boy reputation is well-earned, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turning his life around with the one woman who accepts him for who he is.\n\n Until strangers from the past turn Olivia and CashÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world upside down. What they want is something only Cash can give them. And if he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t deliver, then theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re taking the one thing that Cash values the most.\n\n Olivia always knew that in falling for Cash she was likely to get burned. But this new threat is beyond anything she imagined. Now she has to trust Cash with her lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€and for Olivia thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much easier than letting go, and trusting him with her heart.\n\n\nEverything For Us  (The Bad Boys #3)\nOlivia TownsendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wealthy cousin Marissa had everything a girl could ask forÃ¢â‚¬â€a great job, a privileged life, and all the friends she wanted. Or, at least, all the friends money could buy. But one case of mistaken identity has turned her privileged world upside down.\n\nAn abduction gone wrong lands her right in the lap of the sexiest, most dangerous man sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever met. To Marissa, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an enigma, but one to whom sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s irresistibly, inexplicably drawn.\n\nWith him comes a new world of freedom and passion, of dark shadows and dangerous secrets, a world where nothing is what it seemsÃ¢â‚¬â€except for the blind passion that Marissa canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t escapeÃ¢â‚¬â€or maybe even survive.\n\nEpub Only","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e60b02ec805eb750369ff65486917813c809e84","amp;dn":"M.+Leighton+-+Bad+Boys+Series+%231-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e60b02ec805eb750369ff65486917813c809e84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,96,176,46,200,5,235,117,3,105,255,101,72,105,23,129,60,128,158,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
