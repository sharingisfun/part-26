Most people (just like me when I started) don't know how to do this. It simply means that when the download is complete, don't press stop or close down your program.

Thanks.\n\nContrastMaster is a plugin for effective contrast enhancement as well as creating dramatic contrast looks, photorealistic paintings and HDR-like effects.
