For the recording, the band hosted a three-day party in March of 2013 at one of their favorite haunts, The Ocean Mist, in Matunuck, Rhode Island. They packed the club to capacity, playing to roaring ovations each night. The resulting album, 45 Live , is among Roomful of BluesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ crowning achievements. The album is a lightning-in-a-bottle blowout, showcasing the larger-than-life vocal and instrumental power of the band.\n\nAt 45-years-old, New EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Roomful of Blues has been around even longer than Alligator Records. For all that time, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve celebrated the jump blues, R&amp;B and early rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll music of the horn-powered golden era of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Roomful donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t simply recreate the famous and obscure 78s and 45s of those years. Inspired by the spirit of the groundbreaking bands of the post-World War II decade, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve breathed new life into vintage songs, infusing them with boundless energy and fiery, swinging solos and vocals. For the last two decades, Roomful has been led by Chris Vachon, one of the most underrated guitarists in the blues. For 40 years, their hard-charging horn section has been sparked by Rich Lataille on tenor and alto sax. Energizing the band on Hook, Line &amp; Sinker is their terrific new vocalist, Phil Pemberton. PhilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performances showcase his flamboyant, multi-octave voice, fun-loving attitude and his deep understanding of the era when jumping blues bands were fronted by huge-voiced singers like Roy Brown, Wynonie Harris and Big Joe. Excellent, marvelous wall-to-wall groovesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦between the wicked guitar work and the brassy horn section, things never stop swinging.\n\n\nghost dog...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:476867fbaecdac2a96bfac79353fec9c37fe88fc","amp;dn":"Roomful+of+Blues+-+45+Live+%282013%29+-+GHOST+DOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"476867fbaecdac2a96bfac79353fec9c37fe88fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,104,103,251,174,205,172,42,150,191,172,121,53,63,236,156,55,254,136,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
