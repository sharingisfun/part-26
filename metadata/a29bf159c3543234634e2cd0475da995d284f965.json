After her three-year career with the contemporary R&amp;B girl group Choice, in 2000 she released her first single &quot;There You Go,&quot; from her debut album Can't Take Me Home. The song garnered commercial success, peaking at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2001, she released her second, more pop rock-oriented, studio album, Missundaztood. The album went on to become a critical and commercial success, with estimated sales of 13 million. The album produced four singles, &quot;Get the Party Started,&quot; &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me,&quot; &quot;Just Like a Pill&quot; and &quot;Family Portrait,&quot; each entering the Top 20, with &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; being her highest charting solo single (tied with &quot;Most Girls&quot;) until &quot;So What&quot; in 2008, peaking at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;Get the Party Started&quot; \n\n2.\t&quot;There You Go&quot; \n\n3.\t&quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot; \n\n4.\t&quot;Just Like a Pill&quot; \n\n5.\t&quot;Family Portrait&quot; \n\n6.\t&quot;Trouble&quot; \n\n7.\t&quot;Stupid Girls&quot; \n\n8.\t&quot;Who Knew&quot; \n\n9.\t&quot;U + Ur Hand&quot; \n\n10.\t&quot;Dear Mr. President&quot; (featuring Indigo Girls)\n\n11.\t&quot;So What&quot; \n\n12.\t&quot;Sober&quot; \n\n13.\t&quot;Please Don't Leave Me&quot; \n\n14.\t&quot;Glitter in the Air&quot; \n\n15.\t&quot;Raise Your Glass&quot; \n\n16.\t&quot;Fuckin' Perfect&quot; \n\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a29bf159c3543234634e2cd0475da995d284f965","amp;dn":"Pink+-+Greatest+Hits+So+Far+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a29bf159c3543234634e2cd0475da995d284f965","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,155,241,89,195,84,50,52,99,78,44,208,71,93,169,149,210,132,249,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
