By implementing a taxonomy (aka a content categorization and storage schema), you can design a long-lasting SharePoint site structure that will serve users well for years to come. This course explains how to use different componentsâ€”including metadata, folders, and customized libraries and listsâ€”to build a maintainable SharePoint document and data management system. Author Gary Yeoman focuses on design techniques that improve the ease of use, management, and maintenance of your SharePoint sites, and enhance search and site performance.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tWhat is SharePoint taxonomy?\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating multiple libraries\r\n\tâ€¢\tUsing metadata\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating custom lists\r\n\tâ€¢\tWorking with columns\r\n\tâ€¢\tEvaluating design choices\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a83a87657b407967971429802d558cc482ef15b5","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Designing+a+SharePoint+Taxonomy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a83a87657b407967971429802d558cc482ef15b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,58,135,101,123,64,121,103,151,20,41,128,45,85,140,196,130,239,21,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
