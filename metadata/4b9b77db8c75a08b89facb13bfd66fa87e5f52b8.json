THe two first albums by Jane are really really good, the two next albums are kinda average imo. With this album they got their act back together again. Not as dark and &quot;Sabbathesque&quot; as their debut &quot;Together&quot;, but just as good. THis is one of their best albums. All the traditional Jane ingredients are here in full force, Hammond-organs, lagging beat, Gibson Les Paul solos and trippy vocals by Klaus Hesse. On this record Jane sounds like a mix between Pink Floyd and Eloy. All of the songs flow nicely together into a flow of pleasant and atmospheric progressive rock you can drift along to. An album from 1976 that  proves the sixties never ended :D Fans of Pink Floyd and spacey symphonic progressive rock in general will undoubtedly enjoy this album, its one of the  bestalbums ever made imho.\n\n320kbs\n\n\nTrack listing\n1.
