Control This has been in the works for a long time and is a great fusion of sounds, mixing elements from different genres.  Be prepared to set aside an hour to listen to this album, it deserves your full, undivided attention.\n\nFree Moral Agents are not afraid to experiment with their music, and give each song its own distinct sound.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“SystoleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ takes you on a haunting, psychedelic trip while Ã¢â‚¬Å“AravandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has some guitar riffs that are slightly similar to that of Mars Volta, giving the song a heavier overall sound.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gem from a Broken HeartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a melancholy and spacey song, progressively leading you away from this world and into another.  You end up, like in the Wizard of Oz, leaving one dimension and into another with broader horizons.  Mendee IchikawaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Control ThisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are beautiful, and ultimately lure you to their music.  Her vocals are hypnotic and slightly resemble Siouxsie SiouxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.  IchikawaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals seem to be the common thread tying all the songs on Control This together.\n\nThe album twists and turns, you never know what direction the music will take you.  Towards the end of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girls with Glasses Only Please,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mendee IchikawaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice does not appear throughout the song, but the unusual, acquired-style of Busdriver makes a brief unexpected appearance.  Following this song, Free Moral Agents cover Sonic YouthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Little Trouble Girl,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ breathing new life into the song.  Overall, Control This is an interesting journey.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7211d53dbc9c50e27b232ec474e183c5e80cf065","amp;dn":"Free+Moral+Agents+-+Control+This+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7211d53dbc9c50e27b232ec474e183c5e80cf065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,17,213,61,188,156,80,226,123,35,46,196,116,225,131,197,232,12,240,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
