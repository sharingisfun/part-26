Also if you like Tortoise, you'll probably like these guys.\nThis includes their first EP &quot;34:26&quot; (with the song &quot;Pattern&quot;) and their first full length album &quot;Our Delicate Stranded Nightmare&quot;.\n\nMP3s\n\n34:26:\n   1. &quot;Part I&quot;\n   2. &quot;Part II&quot;\n   3. &quot;Part III&quot;\n   4. &quot;Part IV&quot;\n   5. &quot;Pattern&quot;\n\nOur Delicate Stranded Nightmare:\n   1. &quot;In Strange Love&quot; - 3:01\n   2. &quot;MagMar&quot; - 3:55\n   3. &quot;Mistress Abyss&quot; - 3:47\n   4. &quot;The High Anxiety Arkestra&quot; - 2:22\n   5. &quot;Chase Scene&quot; - 3:13\n   6. &quot;Rotten Candy&quot; - 4:10\n   7. &quot;Attack of the 40ft.

Go out and buy the albums if you can find them. Go see their shows, as musicians usually get more money from tours than album sales (they're supposed to have a new album this year, so will likely tour). In fact, do anything to support anyone associated with the Mars Volta, the best band in the world :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:570eeb419b75761371a0c6ccffeabb5e25c7e09c","amp;dn":"Zechs+Marquise-34%3B26+%2B+Our+Delicate+Stranded+Nightmare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"570eeb419b75761371a0c6ccffeabb5e25c7e09c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,14,235,65,155,117,118,19,113,160,198,204,255,234,187,94,37,199,224,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
