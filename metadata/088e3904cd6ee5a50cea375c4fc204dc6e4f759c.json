Two discs of songs.  There's a oouple of versions of some of the songs on her first album.  I'm not one to upload and newbie stuff of her's.  Any questions, comments or legal issues can be directed to the comments section of this post.  \n\nMore importantly:  these are soundboard quality tracks that did not make the Pieces of You record.  The nice young man at the Innerchange was kind enough to sacrifice these files for the greater good, though, sadly, for profit (WRONG!!).
