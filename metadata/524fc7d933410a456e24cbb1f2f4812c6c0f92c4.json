I changed the filenames slightly somewhere along the line to make these episodes work with XBMC. Changed the dates on the file names from 20091210 to 2009.12.10. Sorry if this causes a problem but from what I can tell not a lot of people out there seeding these and it would be very inconvenient for me to keep 2 versions of the files. So, here they are.\n\nThis should be every episode released in 2010 + the two episodes released in 2009. I'm going off this list; http://www.trakt.tv/shows/stossel/seasons/1. The only episode not included is &quot;You Owe $200,000 To The Fed&quot;. If I remember right that's a duplicate entry and can be ignored.\n\nSpecials not included. They will be posted in a separate Stossel Specials pack.\n\nThese are not scene rips.\n\nThis was deleted and reposted with specials added. I was going to post a separate torrent with all of the specials but it seems better to do it this way. Here's what was added.\n\n2010.07.01-Stossel-[What's Great About America].Fox Business.CF\n2010.09.25-The Battle for the Future-with John Stossel\n2010.12.17-Politicians Promises Gone Wrong-Stossel.CF\n\nNot sure if they're all skJGZV6z rips or not. If it doesn't have a Fox.Business.CF probably not.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nJohn F.
