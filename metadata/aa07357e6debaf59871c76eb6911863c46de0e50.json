Run the install file (my AVG did notify me as it being a virus, but not to worry it&amp;#039;s clean. AVG&amp;#039;s just like that sometimes...)\n2. in the install process, make sure you chose the Registered version\n3. when prompted, enter the Key in the txt file (copy and paste is ok)\n4. finish the install and you done!\n\ni hope you all like it!\n\nPlease comment!!!!\n\nGuaranteed Spy-ware, Mal-ware, Trojan, and Virus Free!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa07357e6debaf59871c76eb6911863c46de0e50","amp;dn":"Install+Creator+Pro+2.0+Build+24+%2B+Serial+%28fixed%29+%5Bsilentwaing%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa07357e6debaf59871c76eb6911863c46de0e50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,7,53,126,109,235,175,89,135,28,118,235,105,17,134,60,70,222,14,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
