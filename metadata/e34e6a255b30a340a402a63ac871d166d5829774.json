Note that The earlier upload of mine of the videos does not have all of the chapters of the series, though at the time it was all that the author had produced.  Hence, the book offers a more complete view of the material.\n\nDirect Release Myofascial Technique, by Michael Stanborough\n\nThis is the accompanying text to the Michael Stanborough video series, and while often videos cover the material of the videos as well as the book does, in this case the book and the videos are different enough to warrant looking at both.  The videos were strictly made to augment the book, not to replace it.\n\nTrail Guide to the Body, by Andrew Biel\n\nThis is the classic human anatomy text for all massage therapy and other bodyworkers of all sorts.  No person serious about massage should be without it.\n\nTui Na Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A manual of Chinese Massage\n\nA good basic text on Tui Na.  It should be noted that in China, acupuncture and Tui Na are held on the same level of esteem as healing arts, and the training for both are about the same in length.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e34e6a255b30a340a402a63ac871d166d5829774","amp;dn":"Massage+and+Bodywork+Books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e34e6a255b30a340a402a63ac871d166d5829774","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,78,106,37,91,48,163,64,164,2,166,58,200,113,209,102,213,130,151,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
