Goal was &quot;preview&quot; quality, not the ultimate one - what is self-evident from redicolously small file-size. Trade-offs must be included.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).\nFor example; when I finish encoding, I always check out the file, do short preview, rewinding back and forth. It usualy looks ugly - but - then I move back and sit on the sofa, 6 feet away - and everything looks as it should. Nice and watchable, like on older, analog TV set. Not to force you, but take my advice regarding watching seriously.\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: Ro.bin.Ho.od.CAM.2010.[Eng].H264[quark].mp4\nDate: 15/05/2010 15:39:44\nSize: 216,417,296 bytes (206.392 MB)\n\n[ Generic infos ]\n\nPlay duration: 02:11:22 (7882.013333 s)\nContainer type: MP4/MOV\nMajor brand: Apple AAC audio w/ iTunes info version 0\nCompatible brands: ISO Base Media, JVT AVC\nCreation time: 14/05/2010 13:39:24 UTC\nModification time: 14/05/2010 13:39:24 UTC\nNumber of streams: 2\nType of stream nr. 1: audio (AAC Low complexity) {GPAC ISO Audio Handler}\nType of stream nr. 2: video (avc1) {GPAC ISO Video Handler}\nAudio streams: 1\n\n[ Relevant data ]\n\nResolution: 352 x 192\nWidth: multiple of 32\nHeight: multiple of 32\nAverage DRF: 23.913588\nStandard deviation: 0.966372\nStd. dev. weighted mean: 0.936809\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec: avc1\nResolution: 352 x 192\nFrame aspect ratio: 11:6 = 1.833333 (~1.85:1)\nPixel aspect ratio: 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio: 11:6 = 1.833333 (~1.85:1)\nFramerate: 25 fps\nNumber of frames: 197045\nBitrate: 185.608077 kbps\n\n[ Audio track ]\n\nCodec: AAC Low complexity\nBitrate: 32.257363 kbps\nChannels: 1\nSample rate: 22050 Hz\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Sample is included, download it first then decide.\n\nNOTE: It is first English spoken CAM.
