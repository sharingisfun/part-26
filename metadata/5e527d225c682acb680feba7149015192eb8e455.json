As Attila's hordes advance upon Rome, noble centurion Marcian (Chandler) mounts a counteroffensive. Alas, the Scourge of God cannot be stopped by weaponry or sheer brute strength. No, Attila can be halted in his tracks only by the hand of God Himself. Through a deft combination of historical fact and movie magic, this is precisely what happens. Ballerina Ludmilla Tcherina, her voice dubbed by an anonymous American actress, co-stars as Marcian's lady love, while Rita Gam is sublimely cast as Attila's long-suffering daughter. Also appearing as Attila's slave bride is Allison Hayes, some three years away from her starring turn in Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. Filmed on a more spectacular scale than one usually associates with Universal-International, Sign of the Pagan loses some of its scope when shown on television. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047490/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047490/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nDouglas Sirk\n\n\n        Jeff Chandler\t ... \tMarcian\n\n\tJack Palance\t... \tAttila\n\tLudmilla TchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rina... \tPrincess Pulcheria (as Ludmilla Tcherina)\n\tRita Gam\t... \tKubra\n\tJeff Morrow\t... \tGeneral Paulinus\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:28:17\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x368  1.74:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 922 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,16 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e527d225c682acb680feba7149015192eb8e455","amp;dn":"Sign+of+the+Pagan+%281954%29+D.Sirk+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e527d225c682acb680feba7149015192eb8e455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,82,125,34,92,104,42,203,104,15,235,167,20,144,21,25,46,184,228,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
