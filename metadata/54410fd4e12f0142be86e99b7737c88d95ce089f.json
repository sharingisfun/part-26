The off-beat mood for each episode was set right from the opening credits, which featured a naked woman walking into a lake, to music provided by the Canadian group Syrinx. The theme tune was called Tillicum, which made it to Number 38 on the Canadian charts on June 5th 1971. The group was led by electronic music pioneer John Mills-Cockell on piano and organ.\n\nThe filmed series debuted on CTV in September 1970, on Thursdays at 9:30pm, a time period which it held for the three years of its life - by which time the Seventies were no longer coming but had well and truly arrived.\n\n\nThere does not appear to be any full episodes of this series to share.\n\n\nOpening 44 seconds:\nHere Come The Seventies\n\n\nClosing 97 seconds:\nVers l'an 2000 (Towards the Year 2000)\n[MTL French TV version of Here Come The Seventies]\n\nscreenshot: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/v227n1bjz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/v227n1bjz/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54410fd4e12f0142be86e99b7737c88d95ce089f","amp;dn":"Here+Come+The+Seventies+%28CTV+Television+1970%29+Opening+Closing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54410fd4e12f0142be86e99b7737c88d95ce089f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,65,15,212,225,47,1,66,190,134,233,155,119,55,200,141,149,206,8,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
