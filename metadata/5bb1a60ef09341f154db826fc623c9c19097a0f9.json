Founded in 1969 by 'MaÃƒÂ®tre' Mamadou Barry (the one with the big smile on the right) they only managed to get a couple of tracks on two lp collections and three single records on the Syliphone label.\nI suspect this may be a result of their choice of repertoire. In SÃƒÂ©kou TourÃƒÂ©'s Guinea there was a clear preference for the culture of the presidents ethnical group, the MalinkÃƒÂ© (or Mandingo). Susu, Peul (Fula) and the many other cultures of Guinea only featured in the folkloric music of ensembles instrumentaux or in ballet. Kaloum Star's strength lay in the Susu rhythms derived from the yankadi street parties.\n\nAmazingly this is their first album recorded in Paris around 1995 and listed as an essential album in the World Music Rough Guide, enjoy!\n\nEAC log, cue &amp; images","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bb1a60ef09341f154db826fc623c9c19097a0f9","amp;dn":"Kaloum+Star+-Felenko+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bb1a60ef09341f154db826fc623c9c19097a0f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,177,166,14,240,147,65,241,84,219,130,111,198,35,201,193,144,151,160,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
