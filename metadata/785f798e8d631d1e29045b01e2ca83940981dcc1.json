Though they hit number one in 1967 with the infectious &quot;Happy Together,&quot; the Turtles scored only three more Top Ten hits and broke up by the end of the '60s. Kaylan and Volman later joined Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention during the early '70s and also recorded themselves as Flo &amp; Eddie, but were on the oldies circuit with a revamped Turtles by the mid-'80s.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-turtles-p5716/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-turtles-p5716/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Joseph McCombs):\n\nWhere the first Best of the Turtles compilation from Rhino focused on the group's many hit singles, Turtle Wax goes in the opposite direction, spotlighting the singles that just didn't click for whatever reason. In this sense it serves the same purpose as Joni Mitchell's Misses accompaniment to her Hits collection. Not surprisingly, the quality of the tracks here is inconsistent, yet reflective of the Turtles' rapid transformation from imitative folk-rockers to humorous psychedelic popsters. Standout cuts include the should've-been-a-hit &quot;Goodbye Surprise&quot; (which sounds strangely like Uriah Heep), the gentle &quot;Lady-O,&quot; and the rousingly Beatlesque &quot;Me About You.&quot; The remainder of the album bounces haphazardly from eccentric psychedelia to folk angst to bright pop -- much like the Turtles' career itself. Note: the cassette version of this release has only 14 songs to the CD's 20.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/turtle-wax-the-best-of-the-turtles-vol-2-r20684&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/turtle-wax-the-best-of-the-turtles-vol-2-r20684&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000032BI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000032BI&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
