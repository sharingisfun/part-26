Signed to a huge label, with production help from the Dave Allen/Mark Saunders team who worked on the Cure&amp;#039;s brilliant series of late-&amp;#039;80s records (here providing a more balanced sound between guitar effects and direct punch than appeared on What), the Chameleons delivered an album that should have been the step to a more above-board existence on radio and beyond. Right from the start, a stunning upward spiral of a guitar riff begins the unnerving character study &quot;Mad Jack,&quot; the bandmembers mix their skills, experience, and songwriting ability perfectly and take everything to an even higher level. The first half continues with three more stunners: &quot;Caution,&quot; a semi-waltz that moves well, pulls back, and then slams home, &quot;Tears,&quot; a crushingly sad, acoustic ode to personal loss, and &quot;Soul in Isolation,&quot; combining a huge majestic wallop with Mark Burgess&amp;#039; anguished study of alienation. And just when you think it couldn&amp;#039;t get any better -- &quot;Swamp Thing,&quot; the definitive Chameleons song, complex, building, tense, epic, perfectly played (John Lever&amp;#039;s drumming is simply jaw-dropping, the Reg Smithies/Dave Fielding guitar pairing totally spot on), and with one of Burgess&amp;#039; most poetic, personal lyrics. It just keeps going from there, the second half covering everything from more sweeping tunes (&quot;Time,&quot; &quot;In Answer&quot;) to bare-bones melancholy (&quot;In Answer,&quot; &quot;I&amp;#039;ll Remember&quot;). Bonus tracks: an alternate and equally striking &quot;Tears,&quot; the driving &quot;Paradiso&quot; and &quot;Inside Out,&quot; and two covers. The take on Bowie&amp;#039;s &quot;John, I&amp;#039;m Only Dancing&quot; is a quick fun goof, but the version of &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; (Burgess especially has been and remains a massive John Lennon fanatic, quoting songs by him liberally throughout his career) surges and soars, beating out by a mile all the times others have covered it. From back to front, Strange Times could never have enough praise. [British versions of Strange Times on CD and LP came with a second disc of bonus tracks; when the album was reissued on CD in the U.S. in 1995, the bonus tracks were simply added to the album proper, without adding an extra disc.] \n\n\n1 Mad Jack\n2 Caution\n3 Tears  \n4 Soul in Isolation\n5 Swamp Thing\n6 Time the End of Time\n7 Seriocity\n8 In Answer\n9 Childhood\n10 I&amp;#039;ll Remember\n\nBonus cd\n\n11 Tears (*)\n12 Paradiso (*)\n13 Inside Out (*)\n14 John, I&amp;#039;m Only Dancing (*)\n15 Tomorrow Never Knows (*)\n\nRipped at 224kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a93acf4b94618dbd6ae792b1a29ffcb0911849f","amp;dn":"The+Chameleons+-+Strange+Times%28incl+bonus+cd%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a93acf4b94618dbd6ae792b1a29ffcb0911849f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,147,172,244,185,70,24,219,214,174,121,43,26,41,255,203,9,17,132,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
