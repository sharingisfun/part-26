They take out tens of thousands of dollars in student loans, and assume they can pay them off from their high salary jobs after graduation. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a bad assumption.  Half of college students move back in with their parents because they canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t find good jobs.  Students are working as waiters and clerks while struggling for decades to pay for an education they didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t use.\n\nWhere does all that tuition money go?  Only one dollar out of five is spent on instruction.  The rest goes for bloated administrative salaries and multi-million dollar buildings like student centers, workout centers, and gourmet food courts that have little to do with education. These unnecessary frills push the costs up year after year, while national surveys show that students are learning less and less, and many of them are functionally illiterate.\n\nParty schools operate more like adolescent resorts than higher education institutions.  Students are pampered with five-star residences and gourmet food courts, but education is strictly optional.  Students get away with doing as little work as possible while still earning As and Bs.  Half of the freshmen class drops out before graduation.\n\n=======\n\nBenBella Books | 2010 | ISBN: 1935251805 | 236 pages | PDF | 12 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4f93efc65154ea3df1b929f62d27e57e8ac9f0d","amp;dn":"The+Five+Year+Party+-+Craig+Brandon+-+2010+-+PDF+-+GCJM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4f93efc65154ea3df1b929f62d27e57e8ac9f0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,249,62,252,101,21,78,163,223,27,146,159,98,210,126,87,232,172,159,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
