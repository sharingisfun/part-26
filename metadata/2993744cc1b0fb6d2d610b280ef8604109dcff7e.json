The album was recorded following the tragic death of guitarist Steve Clark ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with Phil Collen recording all guitar parts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and dedicated to his memory. The album featured huge singles such as &quot;Let's Get Rocked&quot; and &quot;Make Love Like A Man&quot; and debuted at No. 1 in both the U.K. and USA (and went on to sell over 7 million copies worldwide). The album was produced by DEF LEPPARD and Mike Shipley with Robert &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange as executive producer. The deluxe edition features a remastered version of the original album with a bonus disc of rare, live, acoustic and demo versions.\n\nEnjoy and please seed after you have finished download as long as you can.
