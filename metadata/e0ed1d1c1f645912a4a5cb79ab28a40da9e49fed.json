The assumptions, applicability and limitations of the methods are cleary discussed. Includes such advanced subjects as plasticity, creep, fracture, mechanics, flat plates, high cycle fatigue, contact stresses and finite elements. Due to the widespread use of the metric system, SI units are used throughout. Contains a generous selection of illustrative examples and problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0ed1d1c1f645912a4a5cb79ab28a40da9e49fed","amp;dn":"%5BDJVU%5D+%5B1993%5D+Advanced+Mechanics+of+Materials+5th+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0ed1d1c1f645912a4a5cb79ab28a40da9e49fed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,237,29,28,31,100,89,18,164,165,203,121,171,40,164,13,169,228,159,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
