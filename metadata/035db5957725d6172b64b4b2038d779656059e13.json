It was first published serially in Russian in Russky Vestnik, St. Petersburg, 1868-1869. \n\nThe Idiot ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fyodor Dostoevsky\n\nSynopsis\n\nWritten by one of the greatest literary minds the world has ever known, this ambitious novel is the story of Prince Myshkin, an almost comically innocent Christ-figure who is DostoyevskyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vision of salvation for a cynical Russia.\n\nBiography\n\nFyodor Mikailovich DostoevskyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life was a dark and dramatic as the great novels he wrote. He was born in Moscow in 1821, the son of a former army surgeon whose drunken brutality led his own serfs to murder him by pouring vodka down his throat until he strangled. A short first novel, Poor Folk (1846) brought him instant success, but his writing career was cut short by his arrest for alleged subversion against Tsar Nicholas I in 1849. In prison he was given the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsilent treatmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for eight months (guards even wore velvet soled boots) before he was led in front a firing squad. Dressed in death shroud, he faced an open grave and awaited execution, when suddenly, an order arrived commuting his sentence. He then spent four years at hard labor in a Siberian prison, where he began to suffer from epilepsy, and he only returned to St. Petersburg a full ten years after he had left in chains.\n\nHis prison experiences coupled with his conversion to a conservative and profoundly religious philosophy formed the basis for his great novels. But it was his fortuitous marriage to Anna Snitkina, following a period of utter destitution brought about by his compulsive gambling, that gave Dostoevsky the emotional stability to complete Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1868-69), The Possessed (1871-72), and The Brothers Karamazov (1879-80). When Dostoevsky died in 1881, he left a legacy of masterworks that influenced the great thinkers and writers of the Western world and immortalized him as a giant among writers of world literature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:035db5957725d6172b64b4b2038d779656059e13","amp;dn":"The+Idiot+-+Fyodor+Dostoyevsky+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"035db5957725d6172b64b4b2038d779656059e13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,93,181,149,119,37,214,23,43,100,180,178,3,141,119,150,86,5,158,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
