Otherwise, you will hear static.\n\nNotes and disclaimers:\n\nIt is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.\n\nIf you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.\n\nEno's latest is pure classic Eno ambient bliss. The 24-bit stereo made for a wonderful source and I tried to squeeze as much separation here as I could.\n\nTrack listing:\n\nLUX Parts 1-4\n\n\nEnjoy.\n\nDKA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11860ffdb6931fb3138929db3dbeb348fabcb695","amp;dn":"Brian+Eno+-+LUX+%28SPEC+DTS+5.1+CD+by+DKA%29+%28SBU%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11860ffdb6931fb3138929db3dbeb348fabcb695","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,134,15,253,182,147,31,179,19,137,41,219,61,190,179,72,250,188,182,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
