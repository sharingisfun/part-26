This mix is much lower in fidelity than the remix that has appeared on every CD version, but it features a number of overdubs that the remix lacks, most notably backup vocals in the bridges of &quot;Time to Get Away&quot; and piano on the instrumental passages of &quot;The Sun Set&quot;. Thanks to Thom Osburn for sharing this otherwise lost mix with me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43008e5446830e8c86078dc1e8e46faa6a96b30a","amp;dn":"The+Moody+Blues+-+Days+of+Future+Passed+%28original+mix%2C+Dutch+hal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43008e5446830e8c86078dc1e8e46faa6a96b30a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,0,142,84,70,131,14,140,134,7,141,193,232,228,111,170,106,150,179,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
