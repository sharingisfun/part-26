You will have to ensure that they have a constant supply of oxygen, food and water to stay alive.\r\n\r\nYou will get them to collect energy, extract water, mine metal, grow food, manufacture bots, and build a fully self-sufficient base.\r\n\r\n Even if the game is not intended to be a simulator, all the mechanics are plausible, and based on what the expected challenges of establishing a colony in an new planet would be.\r\n\r\n System Requirements\r\n\r\n Minimum:\r\n OS: Windows Vista/7/8/10\r\n Processor: 2 GHz Dual Core\r\n Memory: 2 GB RAM\r\n Graphics: 512 MB VRAM (Shader Model 3)\r\n DirectX: Version 9.0c\r\n Hard Drive: 550 MB available space \r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY CHANGES\r\n\r\n - Removing solar flares from desert planet as this was making the game too hard too early, it also makes planets more different.\r\n - Guards now have 20% armor (they were always meant to, this was a bug).\r\n - Colonists and Bots inside the Mine are now unaffected by solar flares or sandstorms\r\n - If you are low on Food/Spares/Medical Supplies, there is a high chance you will get a merchant bringing these goods\r\n - You can now delete resources laying on the ground AI TWEAKS\r\n\r\n - AI will now prefer to repair very damaged buildings over less damaged ones (as long as they are not much further).\r\n - Setting a structure to high priority now has a more dramatic effect on AI behavior: They will prefer to work there before carrying stuff around or relaxing.\r\n - Better AI behavior when base is on alert: Anyone walking outside will go inside immediately, and no one will ever go outside from the inside.\r\n\r\n UI IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\n - Highlighting keyboard shortcuts in a more obvious way.\r\n - Removed &quot;Meteor has been destroyed&quot; notification.\r\n\r\n FIXES\r\n\r\n - Doing basic checks on savegames to ensure they have not been tampered with\r\n - Fixed &quot;Police State&quot; achievement\r\n - Fix for issues with navigation when building to the edge of the map\r\n - Fix for corridors sometimes getting locked by accident.\r\n - Fix for massive storage sometimes having graphic glitches on the doors.\r\n - Fix for colonists getting stuck if there was an unbuilt component placed in an isolated module.\r\n - Fix for resources sometimes getting stuck after recycling buildings.\r\n - Fix for telescope animation bug\r\n - Lowering alert volume sound\r\n - Stability fixes\r\n\r\n**INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:\r\n\r\nOpen Planetbase v 1.0.4.exe , wait for a bit for the self extractor to open, specify the directory where u want to extract the game folder, open the extracted folder and play.....\r\n OR\r\nExtarct it yourself using 'WinRAR'\r\n\r\nAlways open the game using run as administrator\r\n\r\nCheck my FB page for more :\r\nMr DJ repacks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8a946f8c4bdae35e3a5a88d161924f0722d59e2","amp;dn":"Planetbase+version+1.0.4+repack+Mr+DJ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8a946f8c4bdae35e3a5a88d161924f0722d59e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,169,70,248,196,189,174,53,227,165,168,141,22,25,36,240,114,45,89,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
