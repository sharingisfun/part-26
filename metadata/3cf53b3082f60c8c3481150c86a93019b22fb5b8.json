Consistent threads are an emphasis on the potential for art historical analysis to yield 'history' in the broadest sense; the importance of making the theoretical frame of interpretation explicit; and the necessity of textual evidence being brought to bear on upon elements of formal analysis and archaeological context.\n\n\nVOL 2\nWinter On Art in the Ancient Near East Volume II (Culture and History of the Ancient Near East)\nBRILL | 2009 | ISBN: 9004174990 | 542 pages | PDF | 8,7 MB\n\nThis second volume of collected essays, complement to volume one, focuses upon the art and culture of the third millennium B.C.E. in ancient Mesopotamia. Stress is upon the ability of free-standing sculpture and public monuments not only to reflect cultural attitudes, but to affect a viewing audience. Using Sumerian and Akkadian texts as well as works, the power of visual experience is pursued toward an understanding not only of the monuments but of their times and our own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cf53b3082f60c8c3481150c86a93019b22fb5b8","amp;dn":"On+Art+in+the+Ancient+Near+East%2C+Vol+1+%28Off+the+First+Millenium+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cf53b3082f60c8c3481150c86a93019b22fb5b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,245,59,48,130,246,12,140,52,129,21,12,134,169,48,25,178,47,181,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
