Built by Bombardier between 2004 and 2011, the ME 146 is a member of the Traxx family of electric locomotives, classified by the company as 146.2s. The design of the locomotive was based on the BR 185 operated by Deutsche Bahn. Metronom operates private passenger services out of Hamburg Hauptbahnhof across northern Germany, with express passenger trains denoted with Ã¢â‚¬ËœMEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and regional stopping services designated as Ã¢â‚¬ËœMErÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Metronom Regional). A top speed of 160km/h (99mph) makes the ME 146 an ideal locomotive to operate the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s express passenger services. The ME 146 for Train Simulator is available in MetronomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s striking blue and yellow livery and features AFB train power control, SIFA control system, PZB and LZB signalling systems and passenger view. Also included are matching double-deck Bombardier coaches (Doppelstockwagen) and a driveable cab car (Steuerwagen) for push/pull operation. The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Metronom ME 146 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Hamburg-Hanover route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).\n\n\n\n Included elements with this product\n\n\n    ME 146 in Metronom blue and yellow livery\n    AFB train power control\n    SIFA control system\n    PZB and LZB signalling systems\n    Passenger view\n    Double-deck Bombardier coaches (Doppelstockwagen)\n    Driveable cab car (Steuerwagen)\n    Quick Drive compatible\n    Scenarios for the Hamburg-Hanover route\n    \n\n\n\nScenarios included with this product\n\n\n    Three scenarios for the Hamburg-Hanover route:\n    An Introduction to the Metronom ME 146\n    A MidsummerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Night on the Metronom\n    The Early Morning Commuter to Hamburg\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e6b96fc4536483d77ccff58ee82ab5aa293ccf3","amp;dn":"railworks+4+Metronom+ME+146","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e6b96fc4536483d77ccff58ee82ab5aa293ccf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,107,150,252,69,54,72,61,119,204,255,88,238,130,171,90,162,147,204,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
