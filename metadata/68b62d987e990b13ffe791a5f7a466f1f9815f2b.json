Ozlem might not be the most productive singer, she is definitely one of the most influential contemporary pop artists in Turkey. Her songs often have controversial lyrics and with her second album Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒâ€™zÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ she was the first mainstream artist in Turkey releasing an electronic pop album recorded entirely with electronic instruments. She took quite a turn with her previous album, on which she rocked harder and louder than before. After five long years, during which she got married to Cem Ãƒâ€™cal, we were really anxious to hear what OzlemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new album would be bring us. Well, to be frank: the album is definitely not bad; it contains ten very decent pop/rock songs (and one extra acoustic song). But at the same time it sounds a bit safe and smooth, not as creative and adventurous as we hoped and expected from Oz.\n\nStill, the album does not contain weak songs either, so if you are into female European pop/rock singers, Ozlem Tekin is definitely worth checking out and her latest album might offer a good introduction. The songs on the album were written and composed by Ozlem together with her husband Cem Ãƒâ€“cal, Murat Ãƒâ€¡ekem, Can Ã…Å¾engÃƒÂ¼n and Burak UÃƒÂ§kun. It opens with the title track Ã¢â‚¬ËœBana bi'Ã…Å¸ey olmazÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Ã¢â‚¬ËœI am not meÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) in up tempo rock style. Then she slows down a bit with the mid tempo Ã¢â‚¬ËœKimse bilmezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Ã¢â‚¬ËœNo one knowsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), followed by the dramatic ballad Ã¢â‚¬ËœYataÃ„Å¸Ã„Â±m boÃ…Å¸Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ (Ã¢â‚¬ËœMy bed is emptyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), one of the best songs on the album. Then a few mid tempo pop/rock songs follow, among them the traditional Ã¢â‚¬ËœAslan yarimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Ã¢â‚¬ËœHalf lionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), that she turns into an interesting pop tune. The closing track is the beautiful (but unfortunately very short) ballad Ã¢â‚¬ËœSil baÃ…Å¸tanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Ã¢â‚¬ËœAll over againÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), on which Ozlem shows her ability to write touching lyrics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68b62d987e990b13ffe791a5f7a466f1f9815f2b","amp;dn":"Ozlem+Tekin+-+Bana+Bisey+Olmaz+-+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68b62d987e990b13ffe791a5f7a466f1f9815f2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,182,45,152,126,153,11,19,255,231,145,165,247,164,102,241,249,129,95,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
