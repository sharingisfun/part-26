His early accomplishments mark him out as a \ngreat innovator in his field and puts him up with the likes of Jean \nMichelle Jarre.  In his career he has worked with bands such as Gong, \nHawkwind and Steve Hillage and there are aspects of all of these in his \nsolo work.\n\nI first heard 'New Jerusalem' way back, in 1978/9, when it was first \nreleased on vinyl, and I was delighted to find that a re-release on CD, \nin 1992, was still available.  Although short by modern standards, with \nfive tracks playing for just under 40 minutes, this is a very \natmospheric piece that is worthy of closer attention.\n\nThe first track, 'Song for a New Age', opens with acoustic guitar work \nwhich continues throughout, playing to a backdrop of moog sounds \nwith vocals provided by Tim Blake.  This is followed by an excellent \nrendition of 'Lighthouse', written by Blake but known to many as a \nHawkwind song - I have heard many versions of this particular track, \nbut this has got to be my all time favourite.  The use of synthesisers \nand vocal effects at the beginning of the track really places it in the \nouter space setting. \n\nNext comes 'Generator (Laserbeam)' which is a much weaker track, \nthe vocals have a very nasal quality which detract from its appeal \nwhen compared to the rest of the album, however at 3:34 (the \nshortest track on the album) it's livable with!  'Passage Sur La Cite De \nLa Revelation' is the fourth track, this is a purely instrumental piece \nand is superbly effective.\n\nFinally, we come to the title track of the album 'Blake's New \nJerusalem', based on (and in fact using lines from) the poem \n'Jerusalem' by William Blake!  The introduction to this track is \nbeautifully evocative, starting quietly with a repeating pattern than just \nbuilds up and up - it's very hypnotic, seeming to flow over you and \ncarry you along like a river; sometimes fast, sometimes swirling slowly \naround, but always with an insistent driving energy pushing it forwards \nand keeping it moving.  The vocal content is kept to a minimum, thus \nenhancing the overall mood rather than intruding upon it.  This is a \nreal masterpiece and turned out to be every bit as good as I \nremembered it from all that time ago! \n\nOver twenty years on, from its original conception, this album is, \nperhaps, something of a clichÃƒÂ©.  Certainly, it could be tagged 'hippy' \nmusic by those who don't trouble to take the work in context.  \nHowever, the fact remains that if you like this kind of music, or if you \ndon't, it paved the way for much that came later in the rock and \nprogressive world and, as such, I can recommend it as an addition to \nthe collection of any serious keyboard lovers.\n\nSimon 06/07/1999    \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b97c3004985d77cb3a8bceab1f1529bdc3bd159","amp;dn":"Tim+Blake+-+New+Jerusalem+%281978%2C+Classic+New+Age+%40320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b97c3004985d77cb3a8bceab1f1529bdc3bd159","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,151,195,0,73,133,215,124,179,168,188,234,177,241,82,155,220,59,209,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
