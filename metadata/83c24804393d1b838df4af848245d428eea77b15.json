S. Smogorzhevky.\n\nThe booklet deals with a fundamental method of analytical\ngeometry and its ability to describe geometrical figures\nthrough equations. This method permits geometrical study\nand solution of geometrical problems by algebraic means,\nthus making a visual representation of complex spatial\nconfigurations superfluous. Considerable attention has been\ndevoted to the question of representing geometrical figures\nthrough equations, which is often difficult for those who\nbeing to study the method of coordinates.\nDetailed examples have been given to illustrate the\napplication of the method.\n\nThe booklet is intended for senior school chidlren and all\nthose interested in mathematics. \n  \n  The book was translated the Russian by Ram S. Wadhwa and was\n  first published by Mir in 1980.\n\n  PDF | Cover | Bookmarks | OCR | 2.4 MB | 52 pp | 600 dpi\n\n  \n Released on TPB by mirtitles.org\n\n \n\nContents\n  \nIntroduction 7\n1.
