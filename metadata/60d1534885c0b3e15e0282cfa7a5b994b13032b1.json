Barr and first published in 1988. It revolves around a pair of detectives (Jennifer Mays and Gabriel Webb) and their adventures solving puzzling murders. The Maze Agency was a 1989 nominee for the Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards for Best New Series.\n\nThe Maze Agency was first published by Comico Comics for 7 issues in 1988-1989, and shortly before that company ceased operations, it moved to Innovation Comics for another 16 issues (8-23), plus an annual and a special continuing the numbering and running to 1991. Alpha Productions released a single Maze Agency story in the anthology comic, The Detectives #1 in 1993, as well as a prose story in Noir #1 in 1994. Caliber Comics brought it back in the late 90s as a three-issue miniseries. IDW Publishing printed a three issue miniseries in 2005/2006. They also reprinted #1-5 of the original series in trade paperback. A second prose story appeared in the anthology, &quot;Sex, Lies and Private Eyes,&quot; published by Moonstone in 2009.\n\nThe Maze Agency is notable for being one of the few mystery comic books to &quot;play fair&quot; with the reader Ã¢â‚¬â€ i.e. giving out sufficient clues for the reader to solve the mystery. However, in a February 2004 interview, creator and writer Mike W. Barr admitted that &quot;Some of the Maze stories, frankly, are not fair-play whodunits to the reader, in that the story is possibly too complex for the reader to solve.&quot; He cited as comparison an anecdote wherein the two creators of Ellery Queen were giving an interview, and one said &quot;Ellery Queen is always fair to the reader,&quot; to which the other replied, &quot;Ellery Queen is always fair to the reader if the reader is a genius.&quot; As Mike W. Barr is a fan of the series of Ellery Queen mysteries, the comic has much the same feel, sharing qualities such as the occasional &quot;challenge to the reader&quot; to solve the mystery, and an incorrect solution being offered by a character before the real answer is revealed. Barr even used Ellery as a guest star in Maze Agency #9.\n\nThanks to the creative teams and scanners.
