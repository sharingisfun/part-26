The album has a raw, homemade sound (see Lo-fi music), with Smith playing each instrument and recording it on his four-track recorder. Kid Tulsa (Pete Krebs) played snare and cymbal on tracks &quot;No Name #1&quot; and &quot;Kiwi Maddog 20/20&quot;. According to the Elliott Smith biography, Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing, Elliott recorded the album in the basement of the home of then-girlfriend and Heatmiser manager J.J. Gonson. The album was never intended for release, as Smith only expected to get a deal for a seven-inch record, however, after Gonson played the album for Cavity Search Records, they immediately requested permission to release it in its entirety. Smith at first hesitated, and then allowed permission. On December 15th, 2009, Elliott's official website sweetadeline.net announced that Roman Candle will be remastered by Larry Crane and re-released by Kill Rock Stars, now with a US vinyl version.\n\n\n\nTrack listing:\n--------------------------\n\n(All songs written by Elliott Smith except as noted)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. &quot;Roman Candle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n2. &quot;Condor Ave.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n3. &quot;No Name #1&quot; (Elliott Smith, J.J.
