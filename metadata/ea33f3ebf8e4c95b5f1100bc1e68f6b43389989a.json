But THIS album, and THIS band are the real deal.\n\nI first heard of them when my sister had the &quot;Clueless&quot; soundtrack. I couldn't believe what I heard! At that point, I was a junior in high school and had been playing in several bands. I really had no idea of what I wanted any of the bands to sound like. Were we grunge? Were we alternative? Were we metal?\n\nMy best friend and I were always into cheesy pop love songs. We were huge Sinatra fans, huge Lionel Richie fans, but at the same time, we were children of the '80s. We loved loud, distorted guitars and up-tempo paced songs. So when we played in our bands, we never really had any kind of identity.\n\nThe first time I heard &quot;Need You Around&quot; coming from my sister's bedroom, I ran in there and found out who they were, and immediately tried to find out everything I could about them. You have to remember, this was the mid-90s, just before the internet boom. Info on the Popes wasn't easy to find.\n\nI was able to locate the CD (I had to special order it from our local store) and it changed my life. This was it! This was the sound that I had been searching for and trying to imagine. Loud guitars, catchy riffs and most of all, heart-wrenching lyrics of lament sung by Josh Caterer's smooth neo-crooner voice. The production was amazing as well. Nothing sounded too loud or trebly.\n\nI listened to that CD non-stop for literally 2 years. I still listen to songs from the album at least once a week. It is still my standard of what a perfect album should sound like.\n\nOver the years, I've turned dozens of people on to this album (and the Popes in general) and I've always had the same response. &quot;Why the hell have I never heard of these guys?&quot;, they always say. &quot;This is amazing!&quot; So, like I said, any true music fan must own this album.[/quote]\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Smoking Popes - Born to Quit (CDP 7243 8 33831 2)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Smoking Popes\nAlbum................: Born to Quit (CDP 7243 8 33831 2)\nGenre................: Pop Punk\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1995\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 100 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
