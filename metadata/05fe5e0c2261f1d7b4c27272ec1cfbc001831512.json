He\\&amp;#039;s now in trouble with the mob boss, Tom French, who sends Git to Cork with another debtor, Bunny Kelly, to find a guy named Frank Grogan, and take him to a man with a friendly face at a shack across a bog. It\\&amp;#039;s a tougher assignment than it seems: Git\\&amp;#039;s a novice, Bunny\\&amp;#039;s prone to rash acts, Frank doesn\\&amp;#039;t want to be found (and once he\\&amp;#039;s found, he has no money), and maybe Tom\\&amp;#039;s planning to murder Frank, which puts Git in a moral dilemma. Then, there\\&amp;#039;s the long-ago disappearance of Sonny Mulligan. What\\&amp;#039;s a decent and stand-up lad to do?.\n\nPaddy Breathnach\\&amp;#039;s hilarious crap crim caper.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05fe5e0c2261f1d7b4c27272ec1cfbc001831512","amp;dn":"I+Went+Down+%28Brendan+Gleeson%2C+Peter+McDonald%2C+Paddy+Breathnach%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05fe5e0c2261f1d7b4c27272ec1cfbc001831512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,254,94,12,34,97,241,215,180,194,114,114,236,28,251,192,1,131,21,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
