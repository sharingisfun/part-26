Without a single funny line. The result: a one-man show that might have worked with yesteryearâ€™s Govinda and the Sajan Chale Sasural genre. With Sharma in every frame, giving the same pop-eyed look and rattling off dialogues like heâ€™s reading fine print in a mutual fund advertisement, Kis Kisko Pyaar Karu is about one man and his three wives. Thatâ€™s four comedy shows in one. Only, the actual comedy shows on TV are better. \r\nDepending on your sense of humour, this film could be a comedy or a tragedy. For Sharma fans, the answer is clear. For others, the only funny moments in the film come with Sharat Saxena as Sharmaâ€™s on screen father , explaining his own infidelity with a lyric from an old song: \r\nâ€œEk hawa ka jhoka aaya, \r\nToota dali se phool \r\nNa pawan ki na chaman ki, \r\nKis ki hai yeh bhool?â€ \r\nSharma plays Kumar, whose own predicament is explained as a series of accidents. Biwi Number One, Juhi (Manjari Phadnis), is dumped on Kumar by a dying father. \r\nBiwi Number Two, Anjali (Sai Lokur), is forced upon Kumar by a deaf don brother, Tiger bhai (Arbaaz Khan, accompanied by a roar in the background score). Biwi Number Three, Simran (Simran Kaur Mundi) traps Kumar when her own groom runs away.\r\nSince Kumar wants to be a good husband to each of his three wives â€“ this means a good morning kiss to each of them and bushels of lies throughout the day â€“ his lawyer buddy Karan (Varun Sharma) advises Kumar to buy three flats in one building. Less commute, more time to philander. \r\nAnd so it is that Kumar moves in to Cocktail Towers with his three wives, each of whom thinks sheâ€™s the light of his life. The husband resolves his morning goodbye by standing at the building gate and waving at all three wives standing at their balconies, one above the other. \r\nAs might be evident, this film is not about logic. Itâ€™s about how smart Kumar is when it comes to managing his lies and keeping the truth from his three wives. So we gloss over details like the fact that we have no idea what exactly Kumar does for a living, other than wear reflectors and carry briefcases. And weâ€™re expected to laugh at the strategies Karan resorts to in order to save his buddyâ€™s rear end. So the falling of an underwear from one wifeâ€™s washing line to another wifeâ€™s balcony is explained using Newton and gravity in a joke that makes sense only to the makers and the maid who drops the underwear. \r\nKumar deals with his marital stress by dancing away with a girlfriend, Deepika (Elli Avram). So when Kumar is not hiding from one wife or the other, he is busy hiding all three from Deepika and her dad. The film rushes through escapades in a mall when everyone from the wives to Deepikaâ€™s father and Tiger bhai land up and play hide and seek. Lame April Fool jokes come into play and juvenile antics grow with the full moon on a Karva Chauth night. \r\nThe one good thing about KKPK is the pace at which Abbas-Mustan keep the film moving. Given more believable situations and lines, they might have done better. Meanwhile, if the sight of Kumar hanging on a wall and bringing in the moon, makes you laugh, go watch KKPK, but at your own risk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9c08cb502148ff4cadd828366503d8c31db2231","amp;dn":"Kis+Kisko+Pyaar+Karu+2015+Hindi+TS+AAC-SSM.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9c08cb502148ff4cadd828366503d8c31db2231","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,192,140,181,2,20,143,244,202,221,130,131,102,80,61,140,49,219,34,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
