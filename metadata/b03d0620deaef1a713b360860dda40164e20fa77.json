We're counting down the forty most popular songs in the nation and we're on our way to a brand new number one.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThe man with more chart records than anyone else in history is at number 36 with &quot;Way Down&quot; and since no one is surprised to hear that man is Elvis Presley, Casey reveals who holds second place (trailing by 43 hits).\n\n&quot;Ariel&quot; (at number 33) by Dean Friedman, fell of the chart 2 weeks ago and has since made a comeback. It is a &quot;boy meets then loses girl&quot; song but because of editing, this version seems more like a speed-date. When I saw Friedman on Dick Clark's &quot;American Bandstand&quot; (in the summer of '77) he played a second song titled &quot;Woman Of Mine&quot; from the same album. As a RocketMan Extra, I've included the original-length &quot;Ariel&quot; and the never-before torrented &quot;Woman Of Mine&quot; (not even Friedman could find a copy to download before now).\n\nFleetwood Mac has back-to-back hits with &quot;Dreams&quot; at number 32 next door to &quot;Don't Stop&quot; at number 31.\n\nNot to be outdone, songs about telephones have changed their numbers. &quot;Telephone Line&quot; by the Electric Light Orchestra moves up four (to number 29) eliminating its long distance from &quot;Telephone Man&quot; by Meri Wilson which climbs two (to number 28).\n\nIn the year since Billboard started its disco chart, only one male singer has been able to hit number one on the pop, soul, and disco charts with the same song. That song is in this countdown.\n\nCasey gives a Special Report on drummer Hal Blaine, who has played on 50 number one hits, over 150 top ten hits, and 7 Grammy winning Records-of-the-Year.\n\nA listener asks which family act has hit the top 40 the most so far in the 70's. Casey says a group of brothers &amp; a brother and sister are tied at 18 hits apiece.\n\n40:    (Remember the Days of) The Old School Yard - Cat Stevens\n39:    Slide - Slave\n38:    Black Betty - Ram Jam        \n37:    On And On - Stephen Bishop     \n36:    Way Down - Elvis Presley     \n35:    Smoke From A Distant Fire - The Sanford-Townsend Band    \n34:    How Much Love - Leo Sayer\n33:    Ariel - Dean Friedman\n32:    Dreams - Fleetwood Mac\n31:    Don't Stop - Fleetwood Mac\n30:    The Killing Of Georgie - Rod Stewart\n29:    Telephone Line - Electric Light Orchestra    \n28:    Telephone Man - Meri Wilson\n27:    Give A Little Bit - Supertramp\n26:    Handy Man - James Taylor\n25:    Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love) - Waylon Jennings\n24:    Just A Song Before I Go - Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash\n23:    Barracuda - Heart\n22:    High School Dance - The Sylvers\n21:    It's Sad To Belong - England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley\n20:    Got To Give It Up Part 1 - Marvin Gaye\n19:    Gonna Fly Now (Theme from &quot;Rocky&quot;) - Bill Conti\n18:    You're My World - Helen Reddy\n17:    Easy - The Commodores\n16:    You Made Me Believe In Magic - The Bay City Rollers\n15:    Jet Airliner - The Steve Miller Band\n14:    Knowing Me, Knowing You - ABBA\n13:    You And Me - Alice Cooper\n12:    Whatcha Gonna Do - Pablo Cruise\n11:    (Your Love Has Lifted Me) Higher And Higher - Rita Coolidge\n10:    Best Of My Love - The Emotions\n9:    Do You Wanna Make Love - Peter McCann\n8:    Margaritaville - Jimmy Buffett\n7:    Undercover Angel - Alan O'Day\n6:    Angel In Your Arms - Hot\n5:    My Heart Belongs To Me - Barbra Streisand\n4:    I'm In You - Peter Frampton\n3:    Da Do Ron Ron - Shaun Cassidy\n2:    I Just Want To Be Your Everything - Andy Gibb\n1:    Looks Like We Made It - Barry Manilow","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b03d0620deaef1a713b360860dda40164e20fa77","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1977_July_23rd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b03d0620deaef1a713b360860dda40164e20fa77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,61,6,32,222,174,241,167,19,179,96,134,13,218,64,22,78,32,250,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
