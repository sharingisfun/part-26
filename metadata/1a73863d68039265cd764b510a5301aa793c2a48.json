Slipknot) (2002)\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Slipknot made their mainstream debut in the late '90s, singer Corey Taylor and guitarist Jim Root got their start a few years prior in Stone Sour. Described as a cross between Metallica and Alice in Chains, the group spent several years playing the Iowa bar circuit before the two men joined Slipknot. Stone Sour re-formed in the early 2000s, though, and quickly distinguished themselves with a pair of gold-selling albums and three Grammy nominations.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Get Inside\n02.Orchids\n03.Cold Reader\n04.Blotter\n05.Choose\n06.Monolith\n07.Inhale\n08.Bother\n09.Blue Study\n10.Take A Number\n11.Idle Hands\n12.Tumult\n13.Omega (Bonus) (Feat.
