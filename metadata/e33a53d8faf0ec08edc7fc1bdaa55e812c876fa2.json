Epstein, MD, is one of the foremost practitioners of integrative healthcare for healing and transformation. Trained as a Freudian analyst, he abandoned this direction in 1974 to study therapeutic uses of the imagination under the guidance of Madame Colette AboulkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Muscat in Jerusalem. Since then, he has been a pioneer in the use of mental imagery for treating physical and emotional problems. As his work evolved over the years, he has become a leading exponent of the Western spiritual tradition and its application to healing and therapeutics.\n\nIn 1981, as a result of his clinical experiences, he wrote Waking Dream Therapy. Dr. Epstein authored Healing Visualizations in 1989, now considered the classic book on the therapeutic mental imagery. Inspired by the Bible and the Western spiritual tradition, he wrote Healing Into Immortality (1994), a clear account of the reasons and remedies for illness. In his 1999 book Climbing JacobÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ladder, he takes the reader on an experiential journey through the Bible to find a way to spiritual freedom. In his latest book, Living Kabbalah, he weaves the wisdom of the Kabbalah with guided imagery to master everyday challenges.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e33a53d8faf0ec08edc7fc1bdaa55e812c876fa2","amp;dn":"Gerald+Epstein+-+The+Phoenix+Process+-+%5B6+Cds+-+1+pdf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e33a53d8faf0ec08edc7fc1bdaa55e812c876fa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,58,83,216,250,240,236,8,237,199,252,27,218,165,94,129,44,135,111,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
