The FishermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Son\n\nMinistry of Public Affairs, 1940\n\nLength: 115 minutes\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Language: Latvian\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Subtitles: English, Russian, Latvian\nYear: 1940\n\nScreenwriter and Director: Vilis Lapenieks\n(adapted from the novel by Vilis LÃ„ï¿½cis)\nOperator: AlfrÃ„â€œds Polis\nComposer: JÃ„ï¿½nis MediÃ…â€ Ã…Â¡\nArt Director: ArtÃ…Â«rs Cimermanis\nProducer: Eduards Ã…Â½ebrovskis\n\nIn terms of social resonance, Vilis LapenieksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ film The FishermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Son has no equal. The film adaptation of Vilis LÃ„ï¿½cisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ popular novel was a national blockbuster and created such excitement that at its premiere on 2 January, 1940, the public at the Splendid Palace broke down the theatreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doors. Deemed a Ã¢â‚¬Å“relic of bourgeois LatviaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, it was hidden during the Soviet years; when independence was regained, the film was once again up on the screen and became a symbol of the youth of the free Latvia. Slightly naive, fresh as a sea breeze, heartfelt and as real as a child of nature Ã¢â‚¬â€œ LatviaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first feature film.\n\nOskars lives in a typical sea-side village, but wants to break free of his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rule and the old ways Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he dreams of new, large nets, an ice-cellar, and the fishermenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s independence from the fish wholesaler. At first, no one wants to believe in OskarsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ plans, except for happy-go-lucky Fredis. With the help of Fredis, Oskars builds a new fish trap, gaining admiration from even the old fishermen. Love and deceit also play into the story, as do colorful village characters and folksy songs, which have since been absorbed into the national folklore.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2962caf03b73f9523b79d04839f45bfce7c624ad","amp;dn":"Zvejnieka+d%C4%93ls+%2F+The+Fisherman%26rsquo%3Bs+Son+%281940%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2962caf03b73f9523b79d04839f45bfce7c624ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,98,202,240,59,115,249,82,59,121,208,72,57,244,91,252,231,198,36,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
