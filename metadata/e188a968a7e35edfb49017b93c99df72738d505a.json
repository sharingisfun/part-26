(inst. ver.)\n================================================================================\nYes, the instrumental version, your eyes aren't lying to you!\nTaken from promotional CD, this is as close as it gets to unreleased\nNine Inch Nails / Tapeworm tracks: usage of material from both projects\non Saul's album was confirmed by Trent Reznor himself.\nI'm aware that the song &quot;Convict Colony&quot; is missing, don't ask me where to get it.\nI'm also aware that some audiophiles would like a EAC rip in lossless format, but\nyou'll have to live with 192k MP3 for now, even this will upload rather slowly.\nPlease just have patience; yelling &quot;seed, seed, seed&quot; is not necessary.\n\nP. S.\nif you liked it, please support Saul Williams and buy the retail album, it has\nhis wonderful singing and bonus tracks. His earlier albums (Amethyst Rockstar\nand Saul Williams) and a recent one (Volcanic Sunlight) are quite good too.\n\nP. P. S.\nthis upload is dedicated to ETS, you know who you are!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e188a968a7e35edfb49017b93c99df72738d505a","amp;dn":"Saul+Williams+-+The+Inevitable+Rise+and+Liberation+of+NiggyTardu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e188a968a7e35edfb49017b93c99df72738d505a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,136,169,104,167,227,94,223,180,144,23,185,60,153,223,114,115,141,80,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
