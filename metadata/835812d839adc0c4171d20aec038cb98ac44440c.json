With additional chapters on Black Friday, family communication, and navigating the murky waters of politically correct cake greetings (&quot;Winter!&quot;), Wreck the Halls combines Yates's signature blend of wit and sarcasm with the most hilarious frosting fails this side of winter solstice. Find sweet relief from the holiday madness (not to mention plenty of laughs) with Wreck the Halls.\nJen Yates has been a clown, a cash office accountant, a Jungle Cruise skipper, a business owner, a children's book inventory expeditor, and a house painter. She currently lives in Florida with her husband, John, and their cats Lily and Tonks.

She can also be found flaunting her flaming geekiness on her other blog, Epbot.\n\nCONTENTS\nAcknowledgments\nThe Disclaimers\nHere We Ã¢â‚¬Å“GoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nLetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Talk Turkey\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s All Relative\nBlack Friday\nDanger: High Yuletide\nChildÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Play\nChappy Chanukah!\nHoliday Wreck Creation\nWinter, Underlined\nWatch Me Be a Rebel\nSanta Scare Tactics\nReal Characters\nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Twas the Night Before Christmas\nNow WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re EveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢!\nSigns and Wonders\nAbout the Author","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:835812d839adc0c4171d20aec038cb98ac44440c","amp;dn":"Wreck+the+Halls+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"835812d839adc0c4171d20aec038cb98ac44440c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,88,18,216,57,173,192,196,23,29,32,174,192,56,203,152,172,68,68,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
