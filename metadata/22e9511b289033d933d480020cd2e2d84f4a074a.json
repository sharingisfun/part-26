This music is unhinged from the mainstream, and grounds itself in pure and tasteful psychedelia.\n\nDJ Elation's &quot;Tough Break Kid&quot; tape is the closest sounding thing to this I've ever heard. And that is one of my all-time most sought mixtapes. PM if by the grace of all that's holy you have a passable copy of THAT gem","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22e9511b289033d933d480020cd2e2d84f4a074a","amp;dn":"Soul+Oddity+-+Tone+Capsule+%5B1996%5D+%5BAlbum%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22e9511b289033d933d480020cd2e2d84f4a074a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,233,81,27,40,144,51,217,51,212,128,2,12,210,226,216,79,74,7,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
