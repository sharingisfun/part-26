It is also more ambitious than its predecessor, attempting to tackle social protest (&quot;Controversy,&quot; &quot;Ronnie, Talk to Russia,&quot; &quot;Annie Christian&quot;) along with sex songs (&quot;Jack U Off,&quot; &quot;Sexuality&quot;), and it tries hard to bring funk to a rock audience and vice versa. Even with all of Prince&amp;#039;s ambitions, the music on Controversy doesn&amp;#039;t represent a significant breakthrough from Dirty Mind, and it is often considerably less catchy and memorable. Nevertheless, Prince&amp;#039;s talents as musician make the record enjoyable, even if it isn&amp;#039;t as compelling as most of his catalog.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine, AMG\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEAC Log, Cue &amp; Complete Artwork Included.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\nP.S.: After you&amp;#039;ve done, please someone upload this to Demonoid.
