Aryal believes the new Sentinel to be a criminal, and vows to take him out as soon as the opportunity arises. But the harpy's incessant wrath has pushed Quentin to the limit, and forces him to make a deadly vow of his own.\n\nTo put an end to the conflict, Dragos, Lord of the Wyr, sends them on a reconnaissance mission to the Elven land of Numenlaur. Forced to work together, Aryal and Quentin's antagonism escalates. Each fight draws forth more passion - culminating in an explosively sexual confrontation. But when their mission reveals real danger, Aryal and Quentin must resolve their differences in ways beyond the physical, before the entire Wyr is threatened . . .\nGenre: Fiction, Paranormal Romance\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59ea1209937302fa6d20c52ff6949bce77d08a9d","amp;dn":"Kinked_+Number+6+in+series+%28Elder+Races%29+-+Harrison%2C+Thea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59ea1209937302fa6d20c52ff6949bce77d08a9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,234,18,9,147,115,2,250,109,32,197,47,246,148,155,206,119,208,138,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
