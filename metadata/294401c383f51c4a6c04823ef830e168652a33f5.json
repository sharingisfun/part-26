He approaches his duties as a father with a huge dose of energy and enthusiasm, but his schemes and plans often descend into chaos and confusion.\n\nTom's wife works full time and so he stays at home and does his best to bring up their boys Dylan and Drew. However, no matter what he turns his hand to, his mum, dad, best friend, wife and neighbours all end up sticking their oar in, which is no help to Tom whatsoever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:294401c383f51c4a6c04823ef830e168652a33f5","amp;dn":"Father.Figure.S01E01.HDTV.XviD-AFG.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"294401c383f51c4a6c04823ef830e168652a33f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,68,1,195,131,245,28,74,108,4,130,62,248,48,225,104,101,42,51,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
