South Africa provides more than a third of the 48 sub-Saharan economiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ total GDP. It is AfricaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sole member of the G20 group of influential countries and packs a punch in global diplomacy. Its emergence from the gruesome era of apartheid is a miracle of reconciliation. Africans across the continent and oppressed peoples elsewhere still look to South AfricaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leader as a beacon of hope.\n\nMr Zuma could yet prove to be the right sort of Big Man: big enough to hold his party back from creating something akin to a one-party state, big enough to accept that no one, himself included, is above the law.
