Many are amazed to discover in Revelation 17 that there is also another mysterious character at the heart of prophecy -- a woman who rides the beast. Hunt states in his book:\n&quot;The leaders of the Reformation were certain that she represented the Roman Catholic Church in general and the pope in particular. That belief, however, has been rejected lately by most Protestants as provocative and demeaning to a body of fellow Christians with whom evangelicals desire to work together in the task of winning most of the world for Christ before the year 2000. In fact, the subject of the woman is generally avoided today as too divisive to discuss.&quot;\n&quot;Still, the woman, so vividly portrayed by John, cannot be dismissed so easily. There she is. Two of the final chapters in the Bible are devoted to her. What will we do with her? It would be dishonest to ignore such an important prophetic figure. The entire Bible is God&amp;#039;s Word. We have no more right to close our eyes to Revelation 17 and 18 than to John 3:16.&quot;\nIn this video, past and future come together as Dave Hunt carefully sifts through history, biblical truth, and global events to present a well-defined portrait of the woman and her powerful place in the Antichrist&amp;#039;s future empire. This in-depth study of the doctrines, practices, and history of the Catholic Church includes a compelling look at eight clues in Revelation 17 and 18 that provide undeniable proof that the woman who rides the beast is none other than the Roman Catholic Institution.\n\nCTCA\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f66756c009f1318703455d23bf3a8e3234b9a115","amp;dn":"Dave+Hunt+-+A+Woman+Rides+The+Beast+%28NTSC-VCD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f66756c009f1318703455d23bf3a8e3234b9a115","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,103,86,192,9,241,49,135,3,69,93,35,191,58,142,50,52,185,161,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
