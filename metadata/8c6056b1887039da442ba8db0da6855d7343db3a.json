Cole\nimage\n\n\nBook Description:\nClear explanations, an uncluttered and appealing layout, and examples and exercises featuring a variety of real-life applications have made this text popular among students year after year. This latest edition of Swokowski and Cole's ALGEBRA AND TRIGONOMETRY WITH ANALYTIC GEOMETRY retains these features. The problems have been consistently praised for being at just the right level for precalculus students. The book also provides calculator examples, including specific keystrokes that show you how to use various graphing calculators to solve problems more quickly. Perhaps most important-this book effectively prepares you for further courses in mathematics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c6056b1887039da442ba8db0da6855d7343db3a","amp;dn":"Algebra+and+Trigonometry+with+Analytic+Geometry%2C+12th+Edition+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c6056b1887039da442ba8db0da6855d7343db3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,96,86,177,136,112,57,218,68,43,168,219,13,166,133,93,115,67,219,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
