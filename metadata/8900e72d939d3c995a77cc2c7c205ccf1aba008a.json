The HD image expands up to almost 2 gigabytes!\n\nInstall instructions and a version of Basilisk II for Windows users are included. \n\nI didn't create this image. I lost my first copy - thanks to a forum member whose name starts with T for making it available again! Hopefully hosting here will keep it available for anyone who wants it going forward.\n\n\nHave fun with this great classic software collection!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8900e72d939d3c995a77cc2c7c205ccf1aba008a","amp;dn":"Macintosh+68K+Emulation+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8900e72d939d3c995a77cc2c7c205ccf1aba008a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,0,231,45,147,157,60,153,90,119,204,44,124,32,92,207,26,186,0,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
