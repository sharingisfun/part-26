Better Be Home Soon\n\nI can&amp;#039;t understand the lack of torrents on the web for this one; I&amp;#039;ve seen a few torrents claiming to have the complete CH discography, and they just leave TOLM out. It&amp;#039;s my second-favorite of their albums, behind Together Alone, and contains several of their best songs.\n\nElvis Costello picked this as one of the best albums of the 80s; Bruce Springsteen personally fought for Crowded House once he heard this album, loved it, and learned of the complete lack of commitment/promotion from Capitol Records. It&amp;#039;s introspective, dark, literate, intelligent and catchy pop songwriting of the highest order. And of course it has that wonderful Beatles-like energy that CH always had. If you&amp;#039;re any kind of discriminating listener of popular music (as in &quot;bands&quot;) you need to hear this one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e5a0bb860536e9317dd7230447de8f1297f4ff1","amp;dn":"Crowded+House+-+Temple+Of+Low+Men+%281988%29+LAME+VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e5a0bb860536e9317dd7230447de8f1297f4ff1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,90,11,184,96,83,110,147,23,221,114,48,68,125,232,241,41,127,79,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
