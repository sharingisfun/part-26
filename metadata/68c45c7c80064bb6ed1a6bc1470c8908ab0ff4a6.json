During a tense negotiation of terms between business representatives under the supervision of Lord Vader, one of the members fires a blaster shot at a competitor. Vader is too quick for him, using the Force and lightsaber to defend the target, and kill the shooter.\n\nAfterwards, the unnamed father of the unnamed son killed by VaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hand at the business negotiation forms a security team in search of the best assassin. Going through eight applicants who either ran off with his credits or were killed, the fat businessman uses his resources and a cheaply paid security team to locate his ninth choice. The journey to the Ninth Assassin is like a riddle or a mystery that the reader learns as the encounter unfolds.\n\nThe Ninth Assassin is, in essence, meant to be the equivalent of Boba Fett in the assassination business Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he is impossible to find, has an unknown identity, and allegedly (though evidently) is the best of the trade. He is formidable, skilled, and particularly intelligent Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and basically a new Star Wars character that has potential to end up in the pages of one of Ben ThompsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Badass novels.
