Awesome cover of the Byrd&amp;#039;s Eight Miles High. \n\n&lt;hr&gt;\n\n&quot;The Sunset Strip&quot; is synonymous with action and excitement and certainly has become a focal point of all west coast trends. It is the hub of creativity for the teenset and young adults of Los Angeles - avant garde styles of both dress and behavior are commonplace and flowing beards and unkempt hair are everywhere. On weekends, traffic is backed up for miles - cars filled with tourists gape open-mouthed at a street filled with almost unbelievably dressed people. On street corners, hundreds of the &quot;beat&quot; set gather to discuss everything from LSD to politics, but foremost in their conversation is, &quot;what&amp;#039;s happening in music.&quot;\nIn this album, we are trying to paint sound pictures of the Strip - the voices that you hear above each recording are the actual voices of the Strip&amp;#039;s inhabitants. The traffic noises are real-recorded on location. The songs contained in this album are &quot;what&amp;#039;s happening&quot; - most of them got their start in the Hollywood area and later became national hits.\nThe Leathercoated Minds are typical of the groups that are bred and nurtured by Hollywood. They understand and feel west coast music and have tried to pass along their excitement to you.\nWe sincerely hope that you will be given a mental &quot;Trip Down the Sunset Strip&quot; when you listen to this album.\n\nJ.J.
