However, Anne-Marie Duff later stated that the director and scriptwriter explicitly told her to play the queen as a life-long virgin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f5dc47db075332c1094ae5cb37a29c9ee478602","amp;dn":"The+Virgin+Queen+-+Part+2++%28BBC+2005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f5dc47db075332c1094ae5cb37a29c9ee478602","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,93,196,125,176,117,51,44,16,148,174,92,179,122,41,201,238,71,134,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
