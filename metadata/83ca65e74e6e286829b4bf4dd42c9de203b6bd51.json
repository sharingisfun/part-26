A follow-up television\nseries was made 20 years later (in 2009) with Stephen Fry and Mark Cawardine,\nbut this is the original radio programmes that started it all. The series is\nnarrated by Peter Jones (&quot;the book&quot; from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy).\n\nIn 2001 the series was broadcast in Australia on ABC Radio National where the\nepisodes where given somewhat fancier names. I've included the Australian names\nhere as well for reference.\n\nThe mountain gorilla and the northern white rhino were also visited by Douglas\nand Mark but, sadly, did not make it into the radio series.\n\nThese episodes are available from the BBC web site if you live in the UK, but\nnot elsewhere in the world -- I got the episodes by using a VPN service to\nobtain a UK IP address. The episodes where then recorded by tapping into the\nsystem sound while listening to them in the browser (not very fancy, I know).\nThe sound quality seems (to my ears) to be okay though, and since I went\nthrough so much trouble to be able to listen to the show I should I might as\nwell share. :)\n\n\n0.
