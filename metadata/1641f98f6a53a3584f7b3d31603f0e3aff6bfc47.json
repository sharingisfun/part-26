Jack Tripper met Vicky Bradford and fell in love with her at first sight. In the last episode of Three's Company he proposed marriage but due to her parents' divorce, she doesn't believe or want, but is willing to live with him. So, they move into the apartment above Jack's restaurant. Now Vicky's father who doesn't approve of Jack and even more doesn't approve of their living arrangement buys Jack's restaurant and thus becomes the new owner and is constantly dropping in to disrupt their relationship. Thus Three's a Crowd.\n\n22 Episodes\nTV RIP from previous torrent DVD\n\nSome else had previously ripped the DVD's to MP4 formatte but\nthat torrent is currently stalled. I therefore Ripped them again from \nthe DVD's and here we are. I put a fairly high bit rate on the converter to try and keep the picture quality from degrading any more than it already is(the origionals are recorded from TV's DejaView channel with commercials removed) This is my first torrent upload so I hope I \nhave it right.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1641f98f6a53a3584f7b3d31603f0e3aff6bfc47","amp;dn":"Three%27s+a+Crowd+%5B1984%5D+TV+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1641f98f6a53a3584f7b3d31603f0e3aff6bfc47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,65,249,143,106,83,163,88,79,123,61,49,96,63,14,58,255,107,252,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
