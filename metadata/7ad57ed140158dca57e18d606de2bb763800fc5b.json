The suspected  \n                    murderer Marcus Payne dies without regaining  \n                    consciousness, but his wife Lucy recovers from  \n                    the injuries caused by her husband. Banks must  \n                    find the missing girl Leanne Wray, but time is  \n                    against him and he is hindered by DS Annie  \n                    Cabbot who wants to spend time investigating  \n                    the now suspicious death of the killer. Banks  \n                    knows that Payne must have had an accomplice  \n                    and he questions Lucy. She flirts with Banks,  \n                    emotionally playing him. Banks decides to take  \n                    her in for questioning on the grounds of being  \n                    involved with the rape and murder of the four  \n                    girls and the disappearance of Leanne. But  \n                    things gets complicated when Lucy's background  \n                    and true identity is revealed. Can a victim  \n                    also be guilty?                          \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ad57ed140158dca57e18d606de2bb763800fc5b","amp;dn":"DCI.Banks.Aftermath.Part2.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ad57ed140158dca57e18d606de2bb763800fc5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,213,126,209,64,21,141,202,87,225,141,96,109,226,187,118,56,0,252,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
