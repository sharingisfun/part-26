The familiars Aldwyn, Skylar, and Gilbert have defeated the evil Paksahara, and the Council is throwing Queen Loranella a birthday party to celebrate. But when the queen falls victim to a terrible curse, the familiars find themselves the prime suspects.\n\nNarrowly escaping the palace dungeons, Aldwyn, Skylar, and Gilbert set out on a quest to prove their innocence and find a cure for the queen. Their journey will reunite them with old friends and even older enemies, and it will take them from the far fields of Vastia to the magical Dreamworld. But nothing can prepare them for the puzzles and perils that await them there.\n\nWith all the action, humor, and friendship that have made the familiars so well loved, plus a mystery that will take all their wits to unravel, palace of dreams is the familiars' most thrilling adventure yet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06fdeec5c42967ad0f637ed79848a3401afacb2c","amp;dn":"Palace+of+Dreams+%5BThe+Familiars%2C+%234+%5D+-+Adam+Jay+Epstein+%26amp%3B+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06fdeec5c42967ad0f637ed79848a3401afacb2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,253,238,197,196,41,103,173,15,99,126,215,152,72,163,64,26,250,203,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
