They were clean, and as for the crack, 2 out 54 antiviruses found it as suspicious (The Hacker and McAfee-GW-Edition), and think this is pretty normal for a crack file.\nConsidering that 52 out of 54 antiviruses found it to be pretty clean, including the major ones like Kaspesky, Bitdefender, Avira, Qihoo, Avast etc., and that the other 2 found it simply as suspicious, this file should be pretty safe.\n\nAll thanks go to the original uploader and cracker!
