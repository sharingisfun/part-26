Starting as a weekly in the mid-1920s, the magazine is now published 47 times per year, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. Although its reviews and events listings often focus on cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker has a wide audience outside of New York and USA. It is well known in its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric Americana; its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews; its rigorous fact checking and copyediting; its journalism on world politics and social issues; and its famous, single-panel cartoons sprinkled throughout each issue.\n\n\n The New Yorker - December 2, 2013\n English | HQ PDF | 88 pages | 105.15 Mb\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:433a7cf1a0a6b8e8a7f71b6d9cfb81b63537b95d","amp;dn":"The_New_Yorker_December_02_2013.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"433a7cf1a0a6b8e8a7f71b6d9cfb81b63537b95d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,58,124,241,160,166,184,232,167,247,27,109,156,251,129,182,53,55,185,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
