He recorded it again and again, adding layer upon layer, at home and in dingy Paris studios. One basement laboratory he shared with his pal Mr Oizo, who mixed two tracks on the record. Jackson&amp;#039;s also responsible for some of the artwork, including the deliciously prurient inside painting. As for guests, again, his mother sings on &quot;Fast life&quot;; his four-year-old niece narrates the tale of a mad king on &quot;Oh Boy&quot; which Jackson wrote fuelled on Ricard at his Grandma&amp;#039;s while watching telly with his sister; and cavalier New York rapper Mike Ladd dazzles on &quot;TV Dogs&quot; a Harry Potter hip-hop cyber-swirl.\n\nJackson&amp;#039;s musical influences include scrunching Aphex Twin into Jimi Hendrix, Boards of Canada into Bowie and beyond. Glam romp &quot;Teen Beat Ocean&quot; could be T-Rex spazzing out with Hecker. &quot;The idea is to mix unmatchable elements, to slash boundaries and create tension between opposites,&quot; Fourgeaud says. &quot;Challenging aesthetic codes has been an obsession while making this record. The constantly chopped-up audiovisual environment we&amp;#039;re exposed to in cities through technology is a source of inspiration for me. It&amp;#039;s funny and brutal at the same time. So if I can use this to come out with some emotional shocks, that&amp;#039;s cool.&quot;\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14936cb99d0c3e66625dad060764204aeedcc868","amp;dn":"Jackson+and+His+Computer+Band+by+Dr-Jack+sonny+++VERY+RARE+%21%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14936cb99d0c3e66625dad060764204aeedcc868","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,147,108,185,157,12,62,102,98,93,173,6,7,100,32,74,238,220,200,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
