When we heard that we had the opportunity to record\n  with him, it was a no-brainer,&quot; explained Walker.\n\n  &quot;Upon leaving the studio, we wish to not see home for months at a time, no\n  matter what it takes,&quot; Baylis expressed what could possible be the band's\n  mantra. Striving to perfect their craft not only in the studio, but more\n  importantly live, self-booked tours have kept the band on the road for over\n  two years, including shows with Versa Emerge, Dance Gavin Dance, The Ataris,\n  and more. Life On Repeat played all 6 dates of Cornerstone Festival 2009.\n  While consistent touring is an essential ingredient for the recipe of any\n  successful band, it was a much bigger requirement for the quintet. &quot;In a\n  nutshell, there is no music scene in Salisbury; the closest venues are about 2\n  hours away. We rented out halls and churches to hold our own shows,&quot; Walker\n  described. &quot;Throughout the past year or so, we've basically established our\n  own local scene through the shows we've set up.&quot;\n\n  Of the signing to Equal Vision Records, the band says, &quot;Equal Vision has not\n  only launched the careers of many highly respected artists, but they have\n  maintained a work ethic that continues to prove they are here to stay. From\n  day one, we aspired to be involved with a label that is, in every way, able to\n  properly have our music heard. We couldn't be more excited for what the future\n  holds with Life On Repeat and EVR.&quot;\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
