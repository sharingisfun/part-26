It is not, as one might expect, a straight documentary about the seriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ history. Instead, it takes the history of Street Fighter and mixes it with fan interaction, nostalgia, and expression. Though the documentary tends to drag in places, and has some questionable soundtrack moments, it is, on the whole, a completely fantastic documentary that completely gets and appreciates its target audience. Make no mistake; if you are a Street Fighter fan, this documentary is a great big Ã¢â‚¬Å“thank youÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from Capcom. Fans, you owe it to yourselves to watch this film.\nA big part of this documentary is the showcasing of the variety of ways in which fans have chosen to interact with Street Fighter. The first of these ways to be discussed is through collecting. Considering that this documentary is available only in a CollectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Set, it is a smart and obvious place to start. During this introduction, there is a young man talking about his Street Fighter collection. He is in his Ã¢â‚¬Å“Street FighterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ room while speaking and there are close up cuts to parts of his collection peppered in. He even gets a chance to show off a few of his favorites. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s during this tour of the room that I noticed something in the background that forced me to get out my camera and take a picture of my screen. In his room, on top of a cheap wireframe storage tower, there was a Nubytech Street Fighter 15th Anniversary Arcade Stick. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the same stick that I have on top of my cheap wireframe storage tower. From that moment on, the documentary had its talons securely hooked into me. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m betting that for any Street Fighter fan, a similar moment will occur while watching the Doc. I know this, because that Arcade Stick moment was not the only moment where I felt a sense of comradery through shared nostalgia, experience, or obsession. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fec1045f28a93cf7d579ef0c4848deebd459c10e","amp;dn":"I_Am_Street_Fighter_25_Years_Of_Inspiration_BluRayRip_1080p.h.26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fec1045f28a93cf7d579ef0c4848deebd459c10e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,193,4,95,40,169,60,247,213,121,239,12,72,72,222,235,212,89,193,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
