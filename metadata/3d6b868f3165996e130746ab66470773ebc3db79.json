Charlie is a fierce critic of the Obama administration and has spoken out against Agenda 21. &quot;The politics of globalism is not to better the human condition, but to control it,&quot; Daniels said recently. His latest album CD is The Land That I Love and he has also released a CD single entitled &quot;Let 'Em Win or Bring 'Em Home.&quot; \n\nAlex also talks about Ron Paul's sweep in the delegate process and police caught in the act of drugging protesters. \n\nJoel Skousen, editor of World Affairs Brief and author of Strategic Relocation: North American Guide To Safe Places, talks with Alex.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
