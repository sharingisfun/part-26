Co-produced by Ryan Young of &quot;Trampled by Turtles&quot; and Frankie Lee of &quot;Molly Maher and Her Disbelievers&quot;, this sophomore album features both of its producers as musicians, as well as Richard Medek, Jake Hyer of &quot;The Fiddle Heirs&quot; and others. Robertson has been compared to Mazzy Star, and this album seems to express that influence with its spacey, dreamy quality and lyrics that have a tendency toward meloncholy. Robertson wanted to create a wintery album that could be listened to most of the year. Recorded at Sacred Heart Recording Studio in snowy Duluth, Minnesota, If it Takes All Winter reflects her wintery experiences living in rural Minnesota and Alaska, and tell tales of heartache, separation, longing for a lost love, and unrequited love. But it's not all unhappy. The album includes a love song for Minnesota, and a few other happy tunes that draw on the beauty of winter. Robertson also recorded her first cover song on this album and does a sweet and original version of &quot;You are My Sunshine&quot; by C. Mitchell and J. Davis.
