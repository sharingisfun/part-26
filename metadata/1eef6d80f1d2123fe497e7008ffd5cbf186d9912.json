It should -- that's the bassline from the Clash's &quot;Guns of Brixton&quot; churning underneath an otherwise relatively faithful rendition of the SOS Band's &quot;Just Be Good to Me.&quot; \nWhose atonal guitar riff is that on &quot;I Won't Talk About It?&quot; Why, Billy Bragg's! (That's apparently his tortured falsetto, too). \nAnd there's more -- cribbed snippets of Delta blues, what sound very much like samples of Fela Ransome-Kute, all kinds of interesting and obscure stuff. \nOne could probably get all offended by this sort of bald-faced thievery, but that would just spoil the fun. Cook isn't pretending to be original here; he's just showing how much fun you can have with a sampler and flawless taste in beats. \n(The CD includes a bonus 12&quot; remix of &quot;For Spacious Lies.&quot;) (AMG)\n\n\n\n01.
