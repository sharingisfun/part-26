Crudup visited Chicago in 1939 as a member of the gospel group The Harmonizing Four and stayed to work as a solo artist but was not successful. He toured the country in 1948 with Sonny Boy Williamson II and Elmore James. This session was recorded November 10, 1969 and features Jimmy Dawkins and Willie 'Big Eyes' Smith. Crudup's guitar was amped through the same rotating Leslie speaker that Buddy Guy used on Junior Wells' Hoodoo Man Blues (DMK 612) for seven of the nine songs here. There's also a talk section between Crudup and producer Bob Koester.\n\nTrack Listings\n1. Sunny Road\n2. Trying To Make A Living\n3. Mistake I Made In L.A.\n4. The One That I Love\n5.
