This means there was no cropping so you may see small black bars around the picture's edge. This is exactly what is seen on the DVD source. The problem with cropping MST3Ks is that cropping based on the movie usually over-crops the SOL segments, sometimes a lot. Plus, automatically cropping can pull the picture out of its correct aspect ratio. So these encodes have no cropping, RF=20 constant quality video and AC3 passthru so the audio is identical to the DVD.\r\n\r\nVideo: AVC encode\r\nWidth 720, Anamorphic Loose, Copping Manual 0 0 0 0\r\nDeinterlace=Slower\r\nFPS 29.97 Constant, Preset=Very Slow, Quality RF=20.0\r\nAudio: AC3 Passthru 192Kbps\r\n\r\ntitles with subs have them set off by default\r\nall movie titles have chapters\r\n\r\nBytes................SEp.(Title).(Volume#|Single).(Rhino|Shout).DVDrip.(~subs)[.mkv]\r\n1,311,365,044 701.NightOfTheBloodBeast.Vol16.Shout.DVDrip\r\n1,310,295,938 701t.NightOfTheBloodBeastTurkeyDay.Vol16.Shout.DVDrip\r\n1,137,823,951 703.DeathstalkerAndTheWarriorsFromHell.Vol35.Shout.DVDrip.subs\r\n..919,909,351 702.TheBruteMan.Vol22.Shout.DVDrip\r\n1,174,488,117 704.TheIncredibleMeltingMan.Vol36.Shout.DVDrip.subs &lt;&lt; NEW Vol36-Shout\r\n1,152,909,710 706.Laserblast.Vol13.Shout.DVDrip\r\n\r\nIf these encodes were enjoyable, you don't have the original discs and you can afford them, please consider picking up some the official MST3K DVDs.
