The original SHNs were seekable but\nhad the seek tables as separate files, so I converted them to FLAC to\nmake things easier.  Thanks to Charlie Miller for providing the\noverlap that made this fix possible.\n\nBill Tetzeli\n2/16/2006\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen this source was first circulated, the flac files contained\nREPLAYGAIN tags. The wav files compressed inside the flac files are\nfine, but if you listen to the flac files themselves using a player\nlike WinAMP, these tags cause all the tracks to be played at the same\nvolume. That's not good for concerts where some tracks are supposed to\nbe louder than others.\n \nThere's a new version of this source available. It has exactly the\nsame wav files; it's just the flac wrapper that's different, the\nwrapper doesn't have REPLAYGAIN set anymore. The new version has the\nsame ffp file (since the wav's are the same), but a new md5 file\n(since the flac files are different). The md5 file for the old source\nis called &quot;orig-flac-replaygain-md5&quot;; the md5 file for the good new\nsource is called &quot;flac-md5&quot;. If you have a source for this that\nmatches the ffp, you can create the new source by unflac'ing the old\nsource and then recompressing at flac level 8 using the flac command\nline tool or the flac frontend.\n \nFrom now on, only the new version of the source should be circulated.\n\nSteveSw - Nov, 2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de2647e9928a320a7682eaed8bbe1098e325193d","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+1989-12-06+-+Oakland-Alameda+County+Coliseum+in+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de2647e9928a320a7682eaed8bbe1098e325193d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,38,71,233,146,138,50,10,118,130,234,237,139,190,16,152,227,37,25,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
