And as expected, the two hosts had a lot to debate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the Obama administration to Fox News itself. \n\nDespite criticism from Stewart, O'Reilly brought up a recent poll that found Fox to be more trusted than other networks. Stewart brushed it off by responding that there's a poll which finds him to be the most trusted newsman.\n\n&quot;Here's what I believe,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;Fox News is the most passionate and sells the clearest narrative of any news organization if that's how you're ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ are you still referring to it in that manner?&quot;\n\nThe two batted around the issue of whether Fox is a straight news organization or slants to the right, with O'Reilly telling Stewart that the network's setup is not so different from a newspaper, where there's clearly labeled news and opinion content. However, they had different views on whether its clear to viewers which part is commentary and which is &quot;fair and balanced&quot; news.\n\nSource: http://www.foxnews.com/search-results/m/28885801/entire-jon-stewart-interview.htm#q=jon+stewart   plays online\n\nOther shunster posts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbd11c350b6c60826437a46a1ecc02c01e3c96eb","amp;dn":"Jon+Stewart+Interview+with+O%5C%27Reilly+on+Fox+2010++02++03+++Fox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbd11c350b6c60826437a46a1ecc02c01e3c96eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,209,28,53,11,108,96,130,100,55,164,106,30,204,2,192,30,60,150,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
