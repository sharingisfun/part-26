Racellos' power is being challenged by Muslim secessionists, by the Communist movement and by a rival military group. In the middle of this turmoil stands Hesus Mariano (a quietly volatile Mark Anthony Fernandez) - scholar, musician, sharpshooter, poet, warrior. Jesus the Revolutionary was made on a shoestring budget (around five million pesos / 75,000 euro) and shot in roughly twenty days, but the ideas teeming in it are enough to fill a half-dozen lesser films. Except for the deserted streets and spray-painted graffiti, you won't see any evidence of progress, of advanced technology, any sign at all that it's almost a decade into tomorrow; if anything, things appear to have gotten worse... which is probably precisely Diaz's point. It's an action flick with an attitude, a political satire with a philosophical bent, a science-fiction drama with a committed political stance. The film mixes the influences of George Orwell, Jose Rizal and video games, using the future as a prismatic lens to focus on the follies of the present. \n\nContainer:  \tAVI\nRuntime: \t1h 53mn\nSize: \t766 MiB\n\t\nVideoCodec: \tXviD\nResolution: \t704x524 \nAspect ratio:  \t4:3\nFrame rate: \t29.970 fps\nBit rate: \t800 Kbps\nBPP: \t0.072\n\t\nAudio#1:  \t2.0ch MP3 @ 128 Kbps\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309675/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309675/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Tagalog, Filipino\nSubtitles: English, Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ca2109691592bd5fae12c9d1789a81000484b29","amp;dn":"Lav+Diaz+-+Hesus+rebolusyonaryo++%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ca2109691592bd5fae12c9d1789a81000484b29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,162,16,150,145,89,43,213,250,225,44,157,23,137,168,16,0,72,75,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
