Recorded around the time when she performed some of these songs for the film Let No Man Write My Epitaph, the masterful singer is heard in duets with pianist Paul Smith interpreting 13 songs (even &quot;I Cried for You,&quot; &quot;I Can't Give You Anything but Love&quot; and &quot;Who's Sorry Now&quot;) at slow expressive tempos. Listeners who feel that Ella Fitzgerald was mostly a scat singer who had trouble giving the proper emotional intensity to lyrics will be surprised by this sensitive and often-haunting set. \n\nElla Fitzgerald with\nPaul Smith ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Piano\n\n01.
