The Animals were known for their gritty, bluesy sound and frontman Eric Burdon, as exemplified by their number one signature song &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot; as well as by hits such as &quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place&quot;, &quot;It's My Life&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot;. The band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-oriented album material. They were known in the U.S. as part of the British Invasion.\n\nThe Animals underwent numerous personnel changes in the mid-1960s and suffered from poor business management. Under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals, they moved to California and achieved commercial success as a psychedelic rock band, before disbanding at the end of the decade. Altogether, the group had ten Top Twenty hits in both the UK Singles Chart and the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe original lineup had a brief comeback in 1977 and 1983. There have been several partial regroupings of the original era members since then under various names. The Animals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Animals#Discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Animals#Discography&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Animals_discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Animals_discography&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDE1 - The Animals - 1er EP:\n\n01.
