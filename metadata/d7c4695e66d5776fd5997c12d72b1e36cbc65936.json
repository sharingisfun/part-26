The title track, &quot;I'm Alive&quot;, reached #18 on the Album Rock Tracks chart and #28 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Other singles released from the album were &quot;Everywhere I Go&quot; (UK #67 and &quot;Sky Blue and \nBlack&quot;. The song &quot;Too Many Angels&quot; includes backing vocals by Jennifer Warnes, Valerie \nCarter, Doug Haywood, Katia Cardinal and Ryan Browne while the song &quot;All Good Things&quot; includes backing vocals by David Crosby and Don Henley. The song &quot;Sky blue and black&quot; was also featured in the pilot episode of American situation comedy Friends.\nI'm Alive won the 1995 Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album.\n\nI'm Alive is a striking return to the kind of romantic subject matter that the Los Angeles singer and songwriter seemed to have abandoned after 1980 in favor of political songwriting. His finest album in nearly two decades, it has much in common with his 1974 masterpiece, Late For The Sky, whose songs also described the disintegration of a relationship. -Stephen Holden (The New York Times, November 14, 1993). The album was in Q's list of 'The 50 Best Albums Of 1993' -Q (1/94, p.84).\n\nsongs written by Jackson Browne.\n&quot;I'm Alive&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:01\n&quot;My Problem Is You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n&quot;Everywhere I Go&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n&quot;I'll Do Anything&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n&quot;Miles Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n&quot;Too Many Angels&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:04\n&quot;Take This Rain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n&quot;Two of Me, Two of You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:56\n&quot;Sky Blue and Black&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:06\n&quot;All Good Things&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n\nJackson Browne - acoustic guitar, guitar, piano, vocals, background vocals\nSweet Pea Atkinson - background vocals\nSir Harry Bowens - background vocals\nRyan Browne - background vocals\nMike Campbell - guitar\nKatia Cardinal - background vocals\nValerie Carter - background vocals\nLenny Castro - percussion\nLuis Conte - percussion\nDavid Crosby - background vocals\nMark Goldenberg - guitar\nWilliam &quot;Bill&quot; Greene - background vocals\nDoug Haywood - background vocals\nDon Henley - background vocals\nJames &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchinson - bass\nBill Irving\nJim Keltner - drums\nJohn Leventhal - acoustic guitar, guitar\nMauricio-Fritz Lewak - drums\nDavid Lindley - bouzouki, guitar, oud\nKevin McCormick - bass\nArnold McCuller - background vocals\nDean Parks - acoustic guitar\nSteven Soles - background vocals\nBenmont Tench - Hammond organ\nScott Thurston - guitar, keyboard, background vocals\nWaddy Wachtel - guitar\nJennifer Warnes - background vocals\nJai Winding - piano\n\nripped bydBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7c4695e66d5776fd5997c12d72b1e36cbc65936","amp;dn":"Jackson+Browne...I%5C%27m+Alive%281993%29%5BFLAC---DICKTHESPIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7c4695e66d5776fd5997c12d72b1e36cbc65936","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,196,105,94,102,213,119,111,213,153,124,18,215,43,30,54,203,198,89,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
