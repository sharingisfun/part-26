For example, if you choose romanized you will see ability names\n       such as Majinken, Guren, Kamaitachi, etc.  If you pick translated, you will\n       see skill names such as Demonic Blade, Crimson Lotus, Whirlwind, etc.  When\n       you select one it only lasts for that session; if you turn off your PSP or\n       exit the game, you will be able to select again.\n\n          [SIZE]\n\n       380 MB - One disc\n\n\n         GAME SYNOPSiS\n      &amp;#039;*~.~*&amp;#039;*~.~*&amp;#039;*~.~&amp;#039;\n       Tales of Phantasia begins by showing a heroic battle between four unknown\n       warriors against an evil sorcerer, Dhaos, the outcome of which changed the fate\n       of the world. The warriors were victorious, but Dhaos escaped through time.\n       However, four different heroes are awaiting him: they seal the weakened Dhaos\n       away using the power of two pendants, thus returning peace to the world.\n\n       In the town of Totus ten years after Dhaos had been sealed away, where a young\n       swordsman named Cress Albane and his best friend Chester Barklight live. The\n       town is destroyed by a dark knight named Mars and his soldiers, while Cress and\n       Chester are out hunting in the forest. Every villager is killed in the attack,\n       including ChesterÃƒÆ’?s sister and both of CressÃƒÆ’?s parents. While Chester mourns,\n       Cress vows for revenge. He decides he will head to the town of Euclid, as his\n       mother asked of him before she passed away. The two friends decide they will\n       meet up later, in Euclid.\n\n         INSTALLATION\n      &amp;#039;*~.~*&amp;#039;*~.~*&amp;#039;*~.~&amp;#039;\n       1. Unrar with winrar.\n       2.
