His name has become synonymous with western adventure. Because of his killing speed with a revolver, Buck Duane has lived the lone-wolf life of an outlaw. Every day is a struggle against desperate men anxious to prove themselvesÃ¢â‚¬â€and a bigger struggle to hold onto his basic human decency. So when the Texas Rangers offer to deputize him for a dangerous undercover mission, Buck grabs it as his final chance for redemption. The trouble is, the odds are good that the mission will kill him. In books like The Lone Star Ranger and To The Last Man, Zane Grey takes readers to a time and place where men lived by the speed of their draw and the strength of their convictions.
