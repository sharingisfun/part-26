Rating:  \n \n  4.3 / 5 (based on 21 ratings).\n\nOverview: From Yuen Wo Ping comes an immortal tale of courage and morality, based around the life of one of China&amp;#039;s most formidable fighters, Fok Yun Gap, also known as Huo Yuan Chia. \nInitially prevented by his over-protective father from learning martial arts, Fok Yun Gap (Leung Kar Yan) trains in secret with mysterious Japanese tutor Chiang Ho San (Yasuaki Kurata), eventually becoming a master. Years later when Yun Gap has evolved into a fighting legend, Japan sends a champion to challenge him. The challenger is Ho San. In a tragic twist of fate, the two friends are honor-bound to engage in a potentially deadly duel of unarmed combat. \n\nBased on the timeless Chinese hero that inspired both Bruce Lee&amp;#039;s &quot;Fist Of Fury&quot; and Jet Li&amp;#039;s &quot;Fist Of Legend&quot;, &quot;Legend Of A Fighter&quot; is a cornerstone in the history of Hong Kong cinema. As expected from action legend Yuen Wo Ping, the choreography is superb, providing a skillful juxtaposition of both Chinese and Japanese styles for the numerous battles that punctuate the narrative. The end duel between Leung Kar Yan and Yasuaki Kurata (&quot;Fist Of Legend&quot;) is explosive, technically accomplished, and charged with emotion. \n\nCast: Leung Kar Yan  ||  Yasuaki Kurata (Shoji Kurata)  ||  Yuen Yat Choh  ||  Phillip Ko Fei  ||  Brandy Yuen (Jan Yeung)  ||  Lau Hok Nin  ||  Charlie Chan (Yiu Lam)  ||  Lee Ka Ting  ||  Fung Fung  ||  Huang Ha  ||  Fung Hak On  ||  San Kuai  ||  Yuen Cheung Yan  ||  Fong Yau  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.540378/qx/details.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.540378/qx/details.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
