(Opus 80)\n\t\n\t\t\n\nA cantata for soprano, full choir and orchestra.\n\n\nFor The Fallen\n(Laurence Binyon)\n \n\nWith proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children,\nEngland mourns for her dead across the sea.\nFlesh of her flesh they were, spirit of spirit,\nFallen in the cause of the free.\n\nSolemn the drums thrill: Death august and royal\nSings sorrow up into immortal spheres.\nThere is music in the midst of desolation\nAnd a glory that shines upon our tears.\n\nThey went with songs to the battle, they were young,\nStraight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow.\nThey were staunch to the end against odds uncounted,\nThey fell with their faces to the foe.\n\nThey shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old;\nAge shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.\nAt the going down of the sun and in the morning\nWe will remember them.\n\nThey mingle not with laughing comrades again;\nThey sit no more at familiar tables of home;\nThey have no lot in our labour of the day-time;\nThey sleep beyond England's foam.\n\nBut where our desires are and our hopes profound,\nFelt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight,\nTo the innermost heart of their own land they are known\nAs the stars are known to the Night;\n\nAs the stars that shall be bright when we are dust,\nMoving in marches upon the heavenly plain,\nAs the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness,\nTo the end, to the end, they remain.\n\n Originally published in The Times on 21 September 1914.\n\nThe Fourth Of August\n(Laurence Binyon)\n \n\nNow in thy splendor go before us,\nSpirit of England, ardent eyed,\nEnkindle this dear earth that bore us,\nIn the hour of peril purified\n\nThe cares we hugged drop out of vision,\nOur hearts with deeper thoughts dilate.\nWe step from days of sour division\nInto grandeur of our fate.\n \nFor us the glorious dead have striven,\nThey battled that we might be free.\nWe to their living cause are given;\nWe arm for men that are to be.\n \n\nAmong the nations nobliest chartered,\nEngland recalls her heritage,\nIn her is that which is not bartered,\nWhich force can neither quell nor cage.\n \nFor her immortal star are burning;\nWith her, the hope that's never done,\nThe seed that's in the Spring's returning,\nThe very flower that seeks the sun.\n \n\nShe fights the fraud that feeds desire on\nLies, in lust to enslave or kill,\nThe barren creed of blood and iron,\nVampire of Europe's wasted will....\n \nEndure, O Earth! and thou, awaken,\nPurged by this dreadful winnowing-fan,\nO wronged, untameable, unshaken\nSoul of divinely suffering man.\n \n\nTo Women\n(Laurence Binyon)\n \n\nYour hearts are lifted up, your hearts\nThat have foreknown the utter price.\nYour hearts burn upward like a flame\nOf splendor and of sacrifice.\n \nFor you, you too, to a battle go,\nNot with the marching drums and cheers\nBut in the watch of solitude\nAnd through the boundless night of fears.\n \n\nSwifter, swifter than those hawks of war,\nThose threatening wings that pulse the air,\nFar as the vanward ranks are set,\nYou are gone before them,\nyou are there.\n \nAnd not a shot comes blind with death,\nAnd not a stab of steel is pressed\nHome, but invisibly tore\nAnd entered first a woman's breast\n\nAmid the thunder of the guns,\nThe lightning's of the lance and sword\nYour hope, your dread, your throbbing pride\nYour infinite passion is outpoured.\n \nFrom hearts that are as one high heart\nWithholding naught from doom and bale\nBurningly offered up, - to bleed,\nTo bear, to break, but not to fail !\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16d9d1941d5dfe8f31a78b36edfc6c85e435d399","amp;dn":"Elgar+-+Spirit+of+England+%5B1995%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16d9d1941d5dfe8f31a78b36edfc6c85e435d399","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,217,209,148,29,93,254,143,49,167,139,54,237,252,108,133,228,53,211,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
