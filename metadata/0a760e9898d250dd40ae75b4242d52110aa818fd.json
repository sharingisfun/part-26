Any rumors you may have heard about the &quot;undead&quot; walking our streets are completely preposterous and we officially deny them all. If those rumors turn out to be true simply purchase a firearm from the conveniently located Jakobs Brand Vending Machines and aim for the head. Also, would you mind saving our employees? (Non-union only please)\n\n5 New Areas to Explore \n\nDozens of New Missions \n\nNew Enemies to Eviscerate\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS...\nOS: Windows XP/Vista \nProcessor: 2.4 Ghz or equivalent processor with SSE2 support \nMemory: 1GB System RAM (2GB recommended with Vista) \nGraphics: 256mb video ram or better (GeForce 7 series or higher/Radeon HD3000 series or higher) \nHard Drive: 8 GB or more free space \nSound: Windows compatible sound card \nMAD MOXXI'S UNDERDOME RIOT...\n\nABOUT THE GAME...\nMad Moxxi's Underdome Riot is an addon pack for Borderlands that includes a new cooperative arena game mode and a stash to store your gear. \n\nAre you god's gift to gun fights?

You may have seen some games raise their level cap by 5, or maybe even 10, but with The Crimson Lance Assassination Squads wreaking havoc and Crawmerax the Invincible being all invulnerable and stuff we knew you'd need more than just 10. And that's why Borderlands goes to ELEVEN! The Secret Armory of General Knoxx adds new guns, new Class Mods, new vehicles, new missions, and increases the level cap by ELEVEN. Once you factor in all the new enemy types that need killing you're going to need eleven just to keep up. The Secret Armory of General Knoxx is an add-on pack for Borderlands that raises the level cap to 61, adds new guns, vehicles, Class Mods, shields, enemy types, and missions. In other words...best add-on ever. Of all time. Forever. The End.\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS...\nOS: Windows XP/Vista\nProcessor: 2.4 Ghz or equivalent processor with SSE2 support\nMemory: 1GB System RAM (2GB recommended with Vista)\nGraphics: 256mb video ram or better (GeForce 7 series or higher/Radeon HD3000 series or higher)\nHard Drive: 8 GB or more free space\nSound: Windows compatible sound card\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOTHER COMMENTS...\nExtracted this is ~10.4GB\n\nThe game is already updated and pre-cracked.
