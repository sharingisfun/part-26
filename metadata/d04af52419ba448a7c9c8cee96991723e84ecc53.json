Frightening, complicated, and emotionally resonant, this well-paced episode felt like it came straight out of some of the best eras of Classic Doctor Who. Except for one thing: the score. Watching this episode, we felt that Murray Gold's ham-fisted score was totally at odds with what was being seen on screen. Unwilling to settle for such a rare gem of an episode being compromised by such a letdown of a score, we took matters into our own hands, stripped the music away, and re-did it ourselves. We also made a couple of minor tweaks and edits to improve the flow and atmosphere of this excellent episode.\n\nWe hope that you enjoy this glimpse into what modern Doctor Who could be.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d04af52419ba448a7c9c8cee96991723e84ecc53","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+The+God+Complex+-+Re-Scored+and+Re-Edited","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d04af52419ba448a7c9c8cee96991723e84ecc53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,74,245,36,25,186,68,138,124,156,140,238,150,153,23,35,232,78,204,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
