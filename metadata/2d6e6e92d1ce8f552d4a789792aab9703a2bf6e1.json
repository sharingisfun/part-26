Too many clichÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©d cover choices -- &quot;Five Long Years,&quot; &quot;Mustang Sally,&quot; &quot;Black Night,&quot; &quot;There Is Something on Your Mind&quot; -- to earn unreserved recommendation, but Guy's frenetic guitar histrionics ably cut through the superstar-heavy proceedings (Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Mark Knopfler all turn up) on the snarling title cut and a handful of others.\n\n~ Bill Dahl, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d6e6e92d1ce8f552d4a789792aab9703a2bf6e1","amp;dn":"Buddy+Guy+-+Damn+Right%2C+I%5C%27ve+Got+the+Blues+%281991%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d6e6e92d1ce8f552d4a789792aab9703a2bf6e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,110,110,146,209,206,143,85,45,74,120,151,146,170,185,112,58,43,246,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
