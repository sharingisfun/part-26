After meeting in the high school jazz ensemble, the band formed in 2008 and recorded debut album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Time You Awake.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Two weeks after making their first music video, they got a call from Disney. Ã¢â‚¬Å“So ThereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ went on to air consistently for three months and garnered the attention of some industry professionals in L.A. Not long after, Thirstbusters signed with a management team, a music attorney at Myman Greenspan, a booking agent at ICM, and an acting agent at TalentWorks.\n\nThey have since released other music videos through Cambio and have had songs in movies on TNT and the Hallmark Channel. All band members are Music Majors, studying technique and theory, but the formal training doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop them from rocking out. In fact, the jazz influence enables their music to serve as art as well as entertainment, and makes for especially engaging improvisation at live shows. They regularly sell out Bay Area venues and have headlined fairs including the main stage of the California State Fair. The band released its second album, &quot;Caught Between&quot;, in 2012 and is currently working on new artistic projects as well as performing on a number of live stages.\n___________________________________________________\n\nThis release is up to date on May 22, 2013.
