Yukio throws \nher ring blade at Omega Red and Logan uses it to sever Omega Red's right arm \nand slices the box on his chest, defeating him. Logan learns that Mariko is \nto leave for Madripoor soon so he pulls out a beacon with the X-Men insignia. \nAs Logan and Yukio head to the Yashida house, A.I.M. takes Omega Red, still alive, back to a secret base in a stealth ship. At the Yashida household, Kikyo waits for Logan to finish their fight from earlier. As police storm the house with a search warrant, Logan and Kikyo take their fight to the top of a tower. At the house after finding nobody home, an autopsy report is sent to the detectives who worked with Asano, with the results saying that a hair was found in Asano's teeth with the DNA proving Logan's innocence. At the top of the tower, Omega Red wants to fight Logan with his new cybernetic right arm, \nonly for Logan to win by destroying the box on Omega Red's chest. The fight weakens Wolverine, and Kikyo says he will not fight Logan in his current state as it goes against his code of honor. After the fight, the X-Men's airship the Blackbird decloaks with Cyclops piloting in response to take them to Madripoor.  \n \nSpoken Language: English\n-------------------------------------------\n\nScreens:\n---------\n[URL=http://img716.imageshack.us/i/wolverine105asanoojavit.jpg/][IMG]http://img716.imageshack.us/img716/2779/wolverine105asanoojavit.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 175M\nPlayTime           : 00:19:57.530\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 35890\nVideoBitRate       : 1091844\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\nFormat: Avi\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nHash:\n------\n3F175EAA73068FB2212FE1F6A869FAB5AB57C758\n--------------------------------\n[/center]\n\nJoin us at #Cartoon_Palace onfor more Cartoons and Anime.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f175eaa73068fb2212fe1f6a869fab5ab57c758","amp;dn":"wolverine+-+105+-+Asano+%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f175eaa73068fb2212fe1f6a869fab5ab57c758","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,23,94,170,115,6,143,178,33,47,225,246,168,105,250,181,171,87,199,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
