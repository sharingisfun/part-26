This timeless classic continues to deliver a genuine and unflinching look at what happens to folks whose dreams are forever postponed.\n\nIn 1950's Chicago, three generations of Youngers live in a decaying apartment. As these hardworking American's struggle to overcome a variety of challenges, hope suddenly looms on the horizon. The family's matriarch is poised to recieve insurance money from her husband's death. And everyone has a different idea about how to best use the precious windfall.\n\nAnticipating both the civil rights and women's movements, Hansberry poses the basic questions that triggered these epic struggles. The magnificent full-cast recording of the original 1959 Broadway production demonstrates why this poignant gem still captivates audiences from every walk of life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ed522d7c1e8f93ab04368781dae91a6882d15f2","amp;dn":"Lorraine+Hansberry-A+Raisin+in+the+Sun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ed522d7c1e8f93ab04368781dae91a6882d15f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,213,34,215,193,232,249,58,176,67,104,120,29,174,145,166,136,45,21,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
