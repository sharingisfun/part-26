At a birthday party for the senior partner, John Belney, his erratic behavior causes Belney's beautiful daughter, Mary, to accuse David of being drunk.\nHe is not. David suffers from a rare malady, &quot;liquor recoil,&quot; causing him to become intoxicated at the mere taste of alcohol. He hallucinates during these episodes, and Mary, a psychoanalyst, is fascinated at the way David even imagines a talking dog.\nCity attorney Carl Bellcap is threatening a lawsuit against the firm over the eviction of a Chinese family from its home. David intervenes, saving the day, but firm partner Charles Parkford had been responsible for the eviction and is now livid. Parkford slips wine into David's soup, then enjoys watching the younger man make a public spectacle of himself.\nAt law school graduation, David surprises his colleagues by submitting his resignation, deciding to work instead for Bellcap and the city. Mary hates to see him leave the family firm, but respects David's values and has also fallen in love.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Bitrate: 1295 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime: 82 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 82 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a0d7c441936588fa4fdb8ef05206b3800dc8c1c","amp;dn":"The+Big+Hangover+%281950%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Elizabeth+Taylor%2C+Van+Johnson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a0d7c441936588fa4fdb8ef05206b3800dc8c1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,13,124,68,25,54,88,143,164,253,184,239,5,32,107,56,0,220,140,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
