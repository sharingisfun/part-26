Rob Lulic and Alexander Julien were looking for a fresh new singer to assist them in the upcoming Battle of the bands. After a chance meeting with Manchester born singer Lyndon Johnson, Rymes with Orange was formed. The group has since released four CDs and toured North America, Great Britain, Mainland Europe, and New Zealand.\n\nRWO has had three top 10 singles on Canadian Rock Radio and sales of over 70,000 CDs worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeel 1992\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\nMarvin\nMemory Fade\nHeroes\nHold On\nHome House Flower\nItchycoo Park\nHeaven\nSky\nBig Time\nIn My Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrash 1999\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nCrash\nCircus\nLoving Enemy\nWhy\nStanding In The Rain\nZero\nTalk To Me\nInside Out\nShe's The One\nGet It\nSpaceman\nHeal\nZodiac\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89d27cdd2f5cfc6072936628d009693317f2f87e","amp;dn":"Rymes+With+Orange+-+2+albums+1992+-+1999+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89d27cdd2f5cfc6072936628d009693317f2f87e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,210,124,221,47,92,252,96,114,147,102,40,208,9,105,51,23,242,248,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
