Jimi Hendrix was a fan and borrowed more than just a few licks of Buddy Guy. This has led to people who have never heard Buddy Guy thinking the opposite. When you listen to Buddy Guy - you are not listening to someone who borrowed second-hand of Hendrix - you are listening to the guitarist that Hendrix copied.\n\nThis album also contains the blues standard 'Texas Flood' which had been a staple of blues guitarists for decades before Stevie Ray Vaughan made it his signature tune. In the liner notes of this CD it is said that Stevie got his version from Buddy. I'll leave it to the listener to decide if that is the case.\n  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a962c5b068064656c229fa62f62ce12f6bd9d0e8","amp;dn":"Buddy+Guy+-+Breaking+Out+-+Blues+Guitar+-+Flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a962c5b068064656c229fa62f62ce12f6bd9d0e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,98,197,176,104,6,70,86,194,41,250,98,246,44,225,47,107,217,208,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
