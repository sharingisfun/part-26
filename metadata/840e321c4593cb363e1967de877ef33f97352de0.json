It provides the background needed to understand and master the commercial software packages used by professional engineers in the design and analysis of heat exchangers. This book focuses on types of heat exchangers most widely used by industry: shell-and-tube exchangers (including condensers, reboilers and vaporizers), air-cooled heat exchangers and double-pipe (hairpin) exchangers. It provides a substantial introduction to the design of heat exchanger networks using pinch technology, the most efficient strategy used to achieve optimal recovery of heat in industrial processes.\r\n\r\nUtilizes leading commercial software. Get expert HTRI Xchanger Suite guidance, tips and tricks previously available via high cost professional training sessions.\r\nDetails the development of initial configuration for a heat exchanger and how to systematically modify it to obtain an efficient final design.\r\nAbundant case studies and rules of thumb, along with copious software examples, provide a complete library of reference designs and heuristics for readers to base their own designs on","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:840e321c4593cb363e1967de877ef33f97352de0","amp;dn":"Process+Heat+Transfer+-+Principles%2C+Applications+and+Rules+of+Th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"840e321c4593cb363e1967de877ef33f97352de0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,14,50,28,69,147,203,54,62,25,103,222,135,126,243,63,151,53,45,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
