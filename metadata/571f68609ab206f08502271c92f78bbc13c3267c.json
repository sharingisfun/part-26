His compositions and improvisations are full of \n\ndissonant harmonies and angular melodic twists, and are impossible to \n\nseparate from Monk's unorthodox approach to the piano, which combined a \n\nhighly percussive attack with abrupt, dramatic use of silences and \n\nhesitations.\n\nMonk's manner was idiosyncratic. Visually, he was renowned for his \n\ndistinctively &quot;hip&quot; sartorial style in suits, hats and sunglasses. He was \n\nalso noted for the fact that at times, while the other musicians in the \n\nband continued playing, he would stop, stand up from the keyboard and \n\ndance for a few moments before returning to the piano. One of his regular \n\ndances consisted of continuously turning in a counterclockwise fashion, \n\nwhich has drawn comparisons to ring-shout and Sufi whirling.\n\nHe is one of only five jazz musicians to be featured on the cover of Time \n\n(the other four being Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Wynton Marsalis, \n\nand Dave Brubeck).[3]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:571f68609ab206f08502271c92f78bbc13c3267c","amp;dn":"Thelonious+Monk+-+Thelonious+In+Action+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"571f68609ab206f08502271c92f78bbc13c3267c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,31,104,96,154,178,6,240,133,2,39,28,146,247,139,188,19,195,38,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
