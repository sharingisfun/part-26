College offers a new beginning, a chance to be different. After being assaulted, she's realized that she needs to change and college is just the place to do it. \n\nNobody knows the Ashley she used to be and she'd like to keep it that way.\nAfraid of falling into the same patterns she decides that having no friends, no life and focusing on school is the way to go, but she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bank on someone like Mac as her roommate or the tall, dark and completely geek hot in his glasses, Zeke Whitman.\n\nEzekiel (Zeke) Whitman is driven and focused when it comes to school. When he's forced to partner with a tall, leggy blonde with a slight attitude, he's thrown for a loop. With so much at stake, Zeke canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afford distractions and Ashley is certainly that. From their first encounter Zeke sees more than just another gorgeous girl.\n\nAs Ashley grapples with leaving the Ã¢â‚¬ËœoldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ her behind, she realizes that sometimes changing tunes isn't as easy as it sounds. Sometimes you have to keep a little of the person that you were, in order to become the person that you want to be.\n\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f393c28b76ad9a98fc4babb0847c470dc1c22323","amp;dn":"Changing+Tunes+by+Heather+Gunter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f393c28b76ad9a98fc4babb0847c470dc1c22323","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,147,194,139,118,173,154,152,252,75,171,176,132,124,71,13,193,194,35,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
