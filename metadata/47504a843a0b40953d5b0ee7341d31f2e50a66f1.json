After several strenous months of production, Duda and myself our proud to announce the launch of XFRSCD01ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\nXfer Records is a label started by Deadmau5 and his longtime friend and studio accomplice Steve Duda for their collaborations, such as BSOD, and WTF? with Tommy Lee and DJ Aero. Their latest CD offering is not a music CD, but rather a sample CD-rom for music producers, featuring a plethora of WAV loops and one-shots, ready to be loaded in to any popular music-making software.\nThe CD Features 336 Loops at 128 BPM, 425 Kicks, 229 Clap sounds, over 1500 percussive sounds, 322 Hihats, 158 Snare drums, and over 100 Cymbal and Cymbal-effect sounds. 227 synth/tonal sounds composed and engineered by Duda and the mau5 themselves. An extensive amount of gear was used for\nthe CD-including circuit-bent and analogue drum machines, vintage analogue synths such as Moog and Arp, original acoustic drums and other sounds recorded in various professional studios.  A variety of digital sound sources were used as well for creating new sounds, such as FFT Synthesis, Additive/subtractive synthesis, even custom DSP routines coded by Steve Duda in C++.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDespite the large amount of sample CDs out there, we saw a niche for one geared towards building blocks of EDM with a twist - this one is royalty-free, so it can be used in original productions with no fear of legal repercussions from the original artists who often are sampled on other CD librariesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, says Steve.  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe tried to make an assortment featuring a variety of sound sources, which arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t overproduced so they can fit into a production workflow without stamping their own flavor on a mix and being overly-recognizableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\nOne thing for certain, the sounds of the XFER Sample CD will be featured on dance tracks for decades to come.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47504a843a0b40953d5b0ee7341d31f2e50a66f1","amp;dn":"Deadmau5+XFRSCD01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47504a843a0b40953d5b0ee7341d31f2e50a66f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,80,74,132,58,11,64,149,61,91,14,231,52,29,49,242,229,10,102,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
