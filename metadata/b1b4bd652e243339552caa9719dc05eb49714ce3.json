Honnold (born August 17, 1985) is an American big wall free solo climber. He has broken a number of speed records, most notably including the only known solo climb (mostly free climbing, but using some points of aid) of the Yosemite Triple crown, an 18 hour 50 minute link up of Mt. Watkins, The Nose (El Capitan), and The Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome.[1] He and Hans Florine are the current record holders for the Nose with a time of 2:23:51. Honnold says he likes tall, long routes and he tries to do them quickly.\n\n_______________________\n\n35% faster, no change in pitch, go save some time!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1b4bd652e243339552caa9719dc05eb49714ce3","amp;dn":"Joe+Rogan+Experience+%23319+-+Alex+Honnold+%5B64k%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1b4bd652e243339552caa9719dc05eb49714ce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,180,189,101,46,36,51,57,85,44,170,151,25,220,5,235,73,113,76,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
