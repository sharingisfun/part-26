Five are of KC and the Sunshine Band (about 1974 to 1977). I got them from YouTube for myself so these are live performances (no need for a video if you want to hear the studio recording).\n\nThe sixth video is of the Grateful Dead (looks to be from the documentary &quot;Festival Express&quot; - certainly worth a download). The lyric, &quot;One way or another, this darkness got to give&quot; is from that song and it rang true while I was dealing with my end of the Upload Crises of 2014.\n\nWhen you click to open Firefox and a dialog box asks what program you would like to use to open it with, you know it couldn't possibly get any worse. Then, when your computer says you have no internet access, and asks if you would like to search for help online, you know things are going down-hill quickly.\n\nLearn from my mistakes: Always install those updates, check out the SysinternalsSuite (for users of Microsoft) which has some very useful programs in it (free to all), and create restore points each day all is well!\n\nBe that as it may, I hope you enjoy these, no . . ., I insist you enjoy these videos whether you like it or not.\n\nBoogie_Shoes_ American_Bandstand (uploaded by discolarry124)\n\nGet_Down_Tonight_1977 (uploaded by 1962bine)\n\nI_Get_Lifted_(Instrumental)_Miami_1974 \n\nRock_Your_Baby_Miami_1974 (both uploaded by chuckwagen) &quot;Rock Your Baby&quot; was written and produced by Harry Wayne Casey and Richard Finch of KC and the Sunshine Band and it became a number one hit for George McCrae for two weeks in July, 1974.\n\nShake_Your_Booty_Don_Kirshner's_Rock_Concert (uploaded by KCSUNSHINEBANDVEVO)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecb96ca6d2ad0541e4c6180a47b629db74ebd65c","amp;dn":"RocketMan_Extras_1975_08_16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecb96ca6d2ad0541e4c6180a47b629db74ebd65c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,185,108,166,210,173,5,65,228,198,24,10,71,182,41,219,116,235,214,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
