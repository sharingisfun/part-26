What drew this shy and retiring figure from\nBritish suburbia to the mysterious heart of a faraway subcontinent?\n\nTaking a fresh look at the links between Forster's homosexuality, his\ncritique of the Raj and his remarkably modern capacity for crossing racial\nand cultural borders, Zareer Masani rescues him from the stereotype of an\nold-maidish, closeted gay, writing tea-table novels.\n[b]Unquote[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8154b670d88f3f752da89404e2f3568a7d70c33","amp;dn":"BBC+R3+Documentary+-+%5C%27Forster+in+India%3A+Sex%2C+Books+and+Empire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8154b670d88f3f752da89404e2f3568a7d70c33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,21,75,103,13,136,243,247,82,218,137,64,78,47,53,104,167,215,12,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
