WiiScrubber (version 1.4 anyways) seems to only want to crash, and corrupt my isos in the process :(\n\nBe sure to back up your iso before you try to make any changes!\n\n\np.s. If anyone was wondering, the crash was caused by the Ghosts you can find in the lava ruins. It was why some people also have experienced crashes in their barn, if they tamed one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1238c5ae715919418d3f1f7b329ea58681d17e50","amp;dn":"Rune+Factory%3A+Frontier+Fixed+brsar+%2B+fst.bin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1238c5ae715919418d3f1f7b329ea58681d17e50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,56,197,174,113,89,25,65,141,63,31,123,50,158,165,134,129,209,126,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
