The album title suggests that the 54 songs compiled on Ministry of Sound: One were all number one hits, but that's not entirely the case here. Some were (for instance, the Prodigy's &quot;Firestarter&quot; and Fatboy Slim's &quot;Praise You&quot;) while others were close but not quite chart-toppers (for instance, Underworld's &quot;Born Slippy&quot; peaked at number two, and the Chemical Brothers' &quot;Hey Boy Hey Girl&quot; peaked at number three). Nevertheless, there is a wealth of dance hits on here, and they go all the way back to 1987, when Steve &quot;Silk&quot; Hurley's acid house classic &quot;Jack Your Body&quot; (included here) was the first electronic dance track ever to top the U.K. singles chart. While there are a few other oldies from the '80s (e.g., M/A/R/R/S' &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot; from 1987, Soul II Soul's &quot;Back to Life&quot; from 1989) and quite a few recent hits (e.g., Dizzee Rascal's &quot;Bonkers,&quot; Kid Cudi vs. Crookers' &quot;Day 'N' Night,&quot; both from 2009), most of the songs compiled on Ministry of Sound: One come from the mid- to late-'90s electronica heyday. Fans of that era, particularly those who lived it, will enjoy the blast from the past, though many of these songs were so popular then (e.g., ATB's &quot;9PM [Till I Come],&quot; DJ Sammy's &quot;Heaven&quot;), they still might feel overplayed to even the most nostalgic listeners. That's partly the problem with Ministry of Sound: One, a compilation of material that most dance music fans either already have in their collection or don't care to pay good money for. On the other hand, younger listeners looking for a history lesson in popular dance music couldn't ask for a better compilation. Two other compilations that likewise round up a bunch of U.K. dance favorites from the past couple decades are Gatecrasher's Club Anthems 1993-2009 (2009) and Cream Classics (2004), though these are more oriented toward what was actually spun in British clubs rather than what appeared on the singles chart.. - review by Jason Birchmeier  \n\n\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Hey Boy Hey Girl -  The Chemical Brothers\n[02] Firestarter -  The Prodigy\n[03] We Come 1 -  Faithless\n[04] Born Slippy -  Underworld\n[05] Praise You -  Fatboy Slim\n[06] Brimful Of Asha (Norman Cook Remix) -  Cornershop\n[07] It's Like That -  Run-D.M.C.
