The Cherry 2000 is outmoded and he cannot find an adequate replacement. Heart-broken, his only recourse is a trip across the anarchic desert wasteland to the robot graveyard to find another body to house CherryÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s memory chip. To make the peril-laden journey past the wasteland crazies he enlists the aid of female tracker E. Johnson. But as he and Johnson are forced together on the journey, a mutual attraction grows.\n\n\nFor a film to spend two years on the shelves before getting a release usually signifies major problems, but Cherry 2000 is blissful proof to the contrary. While the title may sound like softcore porn, the film is actually a witty and original variant of the Mad Max 2 (1981) school. This was before the post-holocaust film was routinely resurrected for all sorts of kickboxing and killer cyborg wars in the late 80s/early 90s. Director De Jarnatt isnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t really that interested in the action scenes ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ thereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s quite a novel sequence involving a shootout on top of a car being winched down a dam outlet pipe ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ but that is about it in the action department. Instead he brings an offbeat and off-the-wall sense of humour that quite defies description. The film has a whole witty level of satire on 80s consumer commodification ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ where a sex robot is preferred to the real thing and a one-night stand requires both parties to sign a contract in front of a lawyer. The wasteland crazies are not psychotic gay bikers but are a parody of California swingers who all mouth banal togetherness homilies. ThereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s all sorts of throwaway gags ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Robby the Robot and Gort make appearances in the background of the robot factory ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and the film is peppered with a number of eccentrically memorable one-liners.\n\nThe center of the film belongs to Melanie Griffith. This was before Griffith drifted into mainstream comedy and still had an edge that made what she did worth paying attention to. She quite steals the show with her kewpie doll punkette performance in russet-dyed hair, khakis and silky, china-doll voice. Hers and AndrewsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s relationship becomes a sort of post-holocaust variation on Bogart and Hepburn in The African Queen (1952), and its charm, along with the quirkily askew sense of humour make the film. Although unfortunately David Andrews is rather colourless in his part. Tim Thomerson also does a marvelous job with the psychopathically funny Lester, with some of the best lines. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Tell the girls to make some sandwiches,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ indeed.\n\nThe film never quite established the cult reputation it seemed eminently capable of doing, largely due to poor release by a distributor that had little faith in it. It has considerable charms.[/QUOTE]\n\nMelanie Griffith here is the stuff wet dreams are made of, and Pamela Gidley ain't half bad either!\n\n[IMG]http://bayimg.com/image/ialpnaaba.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://bayimg.com/image/ialpoaaba.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://bayimg.com/image/ialppaaba.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://bayimg.com/image/jalpaaaba.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://bayimg.com/image/jalpbaaba.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://bayimg.com/image/jalpcaaba.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://bayimg.com/image/jalpdaaba.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://bayimg.com/image/jalpeaaba.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://bayimg.com/image/jalpfaaba.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://bayimg.com/image/jalpgaaba.jpg[/IMG]\n\n----my rip------\n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,228,165,120                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:38:22                \nFrame Count:....................................141507             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................688                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................352                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.955                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1531                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.264&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................121                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2          \n\nextras = trailer and making of","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c25c5044307f6b87aa885c36213b5cc42798373c","amp;dn":"Cherry+2000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c25c5044307f6b87aa885c36213b5cc42798373c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,92,80,68,48,127,107,135,170,136,92,54,33,59,92,196,39,152,55,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
