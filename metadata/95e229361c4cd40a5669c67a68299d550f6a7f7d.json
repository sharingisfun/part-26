THE PIG: You know, the traditional tale of a man with big city dreams and how one wrong deal can put you in the woods filming porn with junkie whores, sexual freaks, psycho mobsters and, oh yeah...a pig. THE HOUSE: Thirty years ago a lot of very bad things happened in the way out in the woods. Things that scarred this house forever. Now Melvin is there to investigate the so-called haunted house. He doesn't believe. But he soon will as his dreams smash head first into the memories of a man sentenced to film the most atrocious sex acts imaginable and to experience the nightmare all over again.
