This release 1987 on Pablo.\n\nReview Scott Yanow: \nThis studio album matches together Ella Fitzgerald and the Count Basie Orchestra 16 years after they first recorded together. Basie's sidemen are unfortunately restricted in the Benny Carter arrangements to backup work but Basie has a few piano solos and Fitzgerald is in good voice and in typically swinging form. Highlights include &quot;Just a Sittin' and a Rockin',&quot; &quot;Teach Me Tonight&quot; and &quot;Honeysuckle Rose.&quot; \n\nElla with:\nPete Minger, Sonny Cohn, Ray Brown &amp; Nolan Smith - Trumpet\nMel Wanzo, Bill Hughes, Mitchell 'Booty' Wood &amp; Dennis Wilson - Trombone\nBobby Plater, Danny Turner, Kenny Hing, Eric Dixon &amp; Charlie Fowlkes - Reeds\nCount Basie - Piano\nJohn Clayton - Bass\nFreddie Green - Guitar\nButch Miles - Drums\n\n01.
