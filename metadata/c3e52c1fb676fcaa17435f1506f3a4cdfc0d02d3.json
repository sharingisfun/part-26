The group; Lillias Kinsman-Blake on flute, Shona Mooney on fiddle, Rachel Newton on electroharp, clarsach and vocals, Olivia Ross on fiddle, viola and vocals, Laura-Beth Salter on mandolin and vocals and Amy Thatcher on accordion and harmonium are known for their mix of folk, bluegrass and trad delivered with affecting vocals and lush instrumentals, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMurmurationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, their third release, delivers once again this fine balance.\n\nThe album title explains The SheeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s collaborative nature; as the band note Ã¢â‚¬Å“we feel that the music on this album is particularly honest. We keep returning to the dynamic of the individual and yet the interaction between the group and the way our music draws heavily on our individual influences while maintaining a collective sound. This is illustrated through the murmuration of starlingsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Recording mainly live, the sleeve notes tells us that the album was recorded in just four days, the energy and dynamism of a live recording is well captured.\n\nDown in the Broom, is a subdued but effective intro to an atmospheric album. A stripped down track on viola and fiddle with OliviaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals accompanied by the delicate harmonies of Rachel and Laura-Beth Salter which sets the scene with an rich interpretation of the trad favourite. In contrast Starlings an instrumental which comprises two tunes, Tools and Too Many Socks is a larger affair with LilliasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flute and Laura-BethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mandolin accompanied by the beat of RachelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s electroharp which gives slowly way to Amy ThatcherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accordion for the toe-tapping conclusion.\n\nThe moody Child ballad, Three Nights, returns to the vocals with some slyly sharp accordion. RachelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soft vocals contrasted with the vaporous harmonies of Olivia and Laura-Beth perfectly capturing the sense of menace and dark atmosphere of the gruesome narrative. Certainly, in the traditional tracks, such as Down in the Broom and the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s closer An Till Mise Chaoidh The Shee illustrate just how experimental yet respectful of tradition they are. The slow-air opens with some evocative and haunting fiddle which slowly merges into a bristly conclusion; notes tingling like soft rain punctuated by RachelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quietly passionate vocals. Intended as a love song for the Island of Lewis, the serenity and vitality of the isles is subtly tangible.\n\nAn energetic, pulsating rhythm is palpable in the aptly titled Strut whilst IngeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s/The Musical Chisholm Household/Height of Rudeness is a breezy piece of fiery vigour. Highlights include OliviaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pity Me which sees a return to the country infused tale of strength and resilience delivered with a throbbing and rather funky mandolin and harmonium whilst Our Bottle and Sugarwine show just how fruitful the song writing is on the album. Our Bottle, Laura-BethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s break-up song, layered in the frustration of gin and disappointment, opens with a numbed and muffled echo of a recording which, as with the songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narrative progresses, is brought into stark focus by sobriety and an effectively powerful vocal break. Sugarwine on the other hand is a bright, feel good piece on the promise and excitement of the beginning of a relationship.\n\nMostly self-penned, with a couple of traditional tracks thrown in for good measure, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMurmurationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ revels in more complicated harmonies, and layering of musical influences and styles than in The SheeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut or 2010 follow up Ã¢â‚¬ËœDecadenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. With some beautifully sensitive musicianship and stunning vocals itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard not to be left spellbound...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3e52c1fb676fcaa17435f1506f3a4cdfc0d02d3","amp;dn":"The+Shee+-+Murmurations+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2CLOG%2CCUE%2CFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3e52c1fb676fcaa17435f1506f3a4cdfc0d02d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,229,44,31,182,118,252,170,23,67,95,21,6,243,164,205,252,13,2,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
