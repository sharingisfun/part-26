UNIMPRESSED. AND TOTALLY UNDEAD.\n\nEric's got issues. He has short-term and long-term memory problems; he can't remember who he ate for dinner yesterday, much less how he became a vampire in the first place. His best friend, Roger, is souring on the strip club he and Eric own together, and his girlfriend, Tabitha, keeps pressuring him to turn her so she can join him in undeath. It's almost enough to put a Vlad off his appetite. Almost.\n\nEric tries to solve one problem, only to create another: he turns Tabitha into a vampire, but finds that once he does, his desire for her fades - and her younger sister, Rachel, sure is cute. When he kills a werewolf in self-defense, things really get out of hand. Now a pack of born-again lycanthropes is out for holy retribution, while Tabitha and Rachel have their own agendas--which may or may not include helping Eric stay in one piece. \n\nAll Eric wants to do is run his strip club, drink a little blood, and be left alone. Instead, he must survive car crashes, enchanted bullets, sunlight, sex magic, and werewolves on ice--not to mention his own nasty temper and forgetfulness.\n\nBecause being undead isn't easy, but it sure beats the alternative.\n\n\n\n\nReVamped (VOID CITY 2)\n\nREVIVED. REFRESHED.\nAND READY FOR REVENGE.\n\nEric has lost his strip club, his Mustang, and even Marilyn, the elderly love of his (mortal) life. Even his body was obliterated. In short, they almost got him. But when you're a vampire, &quot;almost&quot; is a very important word. With a little magical help from his friends, Eric is restored to corporeal form, but his treasured Mustang gets caught up in the sorcery and winds up with an unlife of its own. Now, along with &quot;Fang the 'Stang,&quot; he's out to save Marilyn from one of Void City's most powerful soul-stealing demons. But salvation comes at a high price, forcing Eric to venture into his own worst nightmare, Vampire High Society, to uncover the truth about the origin of his powers.\n\nAt the same time, Eric's ex-girlfriend, Tabitha, has begun to wonder exactly what it was that she admired about those High Society Vampires in the first place. Her quest to find her own place in this deceptively vicious circle may lead her right back to Eric's side -- if her little sister, Rachel, doesn't kill her first. And Eric will need all the help he can get, because it looks like someone is after his soul, too. Blood will flow, fangs will be bared, and the claws will come out, because revenge is never pretty...and Eric has plenty to pass around.\n\n\n\nCROSSED (VOID CITY 3)\n\nCOMMITTED. CONFLICTED. AND UTTERLY CHAOTIC.\nIn spite of his continuing hot-blooded affair with his soon-to-be sister-in-law Rachel, EricÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan is simple: Give his vampire girlfriend Tabitha the fancy wedding sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always wanted, then head off to Paris for their honeymoon in the hopes of tracking down his sire, the Empress vampire Lisette. The City of Love proves anything but romantic when the True Immortal rulers of Europe try to block Eric from entering the ContinentÃ¢â‚¬â€and subject Tabitha to a series of challenges to prove her vampire worth. Back home in Void City, EricÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s volatile daughter Greta is getting lonely and boredÃ¢â‚¬â€and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not good news for anyone. And when, like a bat out of hell, Lisette descends upon Void City to wipe Eric and his brood off the face of the earthÃ¢â‚¬â€foreverÃ¢â‚¬â€this much is clear: the honeymoon is over.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5113b6bf0ee809e1ca0af8581a718c5c6f560a90","amp;dn":"J.+F.+Lewis+Void+City+Series+1+thru+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5113b6bf0ee809e1ca0af8581a718c5c6f560a90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,19,182,191,14,232,9,225,202,10,248,88,26,113,140,92,111,86,10,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
