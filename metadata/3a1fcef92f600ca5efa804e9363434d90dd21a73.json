If you want to build a free society, the parts are all at hand.&quot; -Colin Ward \nThis bright little 150 page gem of a book is densely packed with solid examples of anarchism in practice, and sparkles lucidly with the author's intelligence and hope. It's a to-the-point and highly entertaining introduction to practical anarchy. How do we move from here to there. It's a little dated, being that it was written in the 70's but it still offers a lot of insight on building a free society. Mr. Ward discusses schooling, hospitals, crime, work, and many other urgent every-day concerns. He argues that anarchy already does exist, in the interstices of hierarchy and domination, in the everyday workings of people and their everyday interactions, in their neighborhoods.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a1fcef92f600ca5efa804e9363434d90dd21a73","amp;dn":"Colin+Ward+-+Anarchy+in+Action+%281972%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a1fcef92f600ca5efa804e9363434d90dd21a73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,31,206,249,47,96,12,165,239,168,4,233,54,52,52,217,13,210,26,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
