Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a shy young woman, who, after a brief spell in a mental institution, is released in the care of her overprotective mother (Lesley Ann Warren) and hard-drinking father (Stephen McHattie). Hoping to make good on her own, Lee begins looking for a job, and in her free time indulges in her odd habit of inflicting pain upon herself in various ways. Lee is hired as a secretary by E. Edward Grey (James Spader), a grim and ruthlessly efficient attorney who warns her that her work will be both dull and demanding. Lee takes to the job with genuine enthusiasm, and while she's recently acquired a new boyfriend, Peter (Jeremy Davies), she's far more intrigued by Grey's coldly patrician demeanor. While Grey often criticizes Lee, she seems to thrive on his abuse, but one day he crosses a line when he insists upon spanking her after some minor mistake. Lee quite enjoys the treatment, and wants it to continue, but Grey can no longer take pleasure humiliating Lee when he knows that she likes it; he fires her, despite her pleas to be allowed to stay. Finally discovering the key to her sexual and emotional needs, Lee tries to persuade Peter to be rough with her, but he simply doesn't have the taste or talent for it, and Lee soon maps out a last-ditch effort to win back her position with Grey, whatever the cost. Secretary won a special award for &quot;Originality&quot; at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: James Spader, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jeremy Davies\r\nDIRECTOR......: Steven Shainberg\r\nWRITERS.......: Erin Cressida Wilson, Mary Gaitskill\r\nGENRE.........: Comedy | Drama | Romance\r\nRATING........: 7.1/10  65,148 votes\r\nMETASCORE.....: 63/100\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274812/\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 51mn\r\nSIZE..........: 4.15GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080p\r\nBITRATE.......: 4500 Kbps (3-pass)\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO1........: English DTS 5.1 768kbps\r\nAUDIO2........: Director Commentary\r\nSOURCE........: Secretary 2002 Blu-ray Remux 1080p AVC DTS-HD MA 7.1-carlbob\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG, SPA \r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2015-11-12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/R8FkB2L.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/sihz3KQ.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/I4evYuX.jpg \nhttp://i.imgur.com/I4evYuX.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baa9406544b634cb80a628c7a00d0f3bfc3f147f","amp;dn":"Secretary.2002.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baa9406544b634cb80a628c7a00d0f3bfc3f147f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,169,64,101,68,182,52,203,128,166,40,199,160,13,15,59,252,63,20,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
