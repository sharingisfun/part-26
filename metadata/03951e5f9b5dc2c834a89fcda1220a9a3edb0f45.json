Mystique as usual is playing more than one side, and it is up to the X-Men and others to figure out who she is really with - before it is too late. The shapeshifter Raven Darkholme, as she is named, has been a popular villain and occasional anti-hero since her introduction - which also may be due to her deep ties to characters such as Rogue, Nightcrawler, Gambit and Sabretooth in various interesting ways. Thanks to Zone-Empire for these digital copies, please seed and enjoy! :-) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03951e5f9b5dc2c834a89fcda1220a9a3edb0f45","amp;dn":"Mystique+01-24+%282003-2005%2C+Dgtl%2C+Zone-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03951e5f9b5dc2c834a89fcda1220a9a3edb0f45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,149,30,95,155,93,194,200,52,168,159,205,161,34,10,154,62,219,15,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
