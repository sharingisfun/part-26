It has two main components: the client software used to encrypt and decrypt data and the server software (SecureDoc Enterprise Server or SES) used to configure, deploy, and manage encryption for an entire organization.\nThe SecureDoc client software uses a FIPS 140-2 level 1 and level 2 certified AES 256-bit cryptographic engine to encrypt data. WinMagic recommends that all drives be protected with full- disk encryption (FDE); container, and volume encryption can be used to supplement FDE on shared workstations to add another layer of defence for classified data, and to encrypt data on external storage devices such as USB keys, CD/DVDs, and SD cards. The SecureDoc client software provides encryption capabilities on multiple operating systems.\n\nHow it works\nSecureDoc encrypts the entire hard drive (full-disk) on a sector-by-sector basis, and enables authentication at pre-boot to ensure maximum security.\n\nWhat is SecureDoc Disk Encryption?\nSecureDoc Full-Disk Encryption provides true full-disk encryption to laptops and PCs. Robust and Ã¢â‚¬Å“always onÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ AES 256 encryption is combined with a leading range of integrations for strong authentication including tokens, smartcards, biometrics and PKI. SecureDoc can be deployed as a standalone solution or can be centrally deployed from the SecureDoc Enterprise Server (SES). For the enterprise, SES simplifies deployment, reporting and administration, resulting in protection for sensitive data at a low total cost of ownership.\n\nSecureDoc is a highly certified, government-grade AES-256 bit Encryption solution (FIPS 140-2 Level 2, CC EAL 4 certified) that allows organization to increase the ROI on their IT security spend by taking advantage of single or multiple factor authentication and managing hardware based security technologies entering the enterprise. SecureDoc is available in a standalone version, or as part of a centrally-managed solution deployed from SecureDoc Enterprise Server (SES). For individual users, SecureDoc provides a simple, reliable and secure means to protect their data utilizing SecureDoc Full-Disk Encryption (FDE), Pre-Boot Authentication (PBA), port control, disk access control and Removable Media Encryption (RME) capabilities. PBA supports single or multifactor authentication using passwords, USB tokens, TPM, smartcards, biometrics, or PKI.\n\nWinMagic is pleased to introduce new features and enhancements with the recent release of SecureDoc v5 encryption solution:\n\n* Windows (including Windows 7 64 bit), Mac OS and Linux support\n* Strong multi-factor authentication available at pre-boot with single sign-on options\n* OPAL Self Encrypting Drives (SED) Support\n* IntelÃ‚Â® Anti Theft Technology Support\n* Full Disk and File Folder Encryption\n* Removable Media Encryption (USB Flash drives, CD.DVDs, SD Cards)\n* Portable and secure USB encryption (no additional software installation or admin access rights required)\n* Revitalized Dashboard that simplifies workflow and increases productivity\n* Password recovery and self-help functions\n* Crypto-erase for decommissioned/lost/stolen devices\n* Multi-Language Client available in English, Japanese French, Italian, German, and Spanish.\n\nSecureDoc Benefits\n\n* Improves user acceptance with transparent operation and no training required\n* Mitigates data breach risks from lost or stolen laptops or desktops\n* Assists with compliance with privacy and data breach regulations\n* Low total cost of ownership and operations\n\nSecureDoc provides a full range of encryption options for all needs and\ncircumstances.
