They are offered here both in their original texts and in superb English translations by Louise Varese.\n\nRimbaud was indeed the most astonishing of French geniuses. Fired in childhood with an ambition to write, he gave up poetry before he was twenty-one. Yet he had already produced some of the finest examples of French verse. He is best known for 'A Season In Hell', but his other prose poems are no less remarkable. While he was working on them he spoke of his interest in hallucinations - &quot;des vertiges, des silences, des nuits.&quot; These perceptions were caught by the poet in a beam of pellucid and strangely active language which still lights up-now here, now there-unexplored aspects of experience and thought.\n\nOther:\n&quot;Situations have ended sad/relationships have all been bad/Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud&quot; - Bob Dylan, Blood On The Tracks, 'You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go'\n\n&quot;I don't think of myself as Bob Dylan. It's like Rimbaud said, 'I is another.'&quot; - Bob Dylan, Biograph liner notes for 'Up To Me'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3322e76ccfc0bbe0ad1a3a61ae703342db682504","amp;dn":"Arthur+Rimbaud+-+Illuminations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3322e76ccfc0bbe0ad1a3a61ae703342db682504","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,34,231,108,207,192,187,224,173,26,58,97,174,112,51,66,219,104,37,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
