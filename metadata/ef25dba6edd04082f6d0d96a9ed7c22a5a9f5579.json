Trio II (Dean / Rogers / Bianco) 26'01&quot;\n\nRecorded 9th February, 2004 at Steam Room Studios, London\nRecording engineer Jon Wilkinson\n\n\nReviews\n~~~~~~~\n\nBy Tim Niland\n\nAlto saxophonist Elton Dean was a powerful member of the British progressive\nmusic scene from free jazz through his work with Soft Machine and its\noffshoots. Recorded in London during 2004 this is a stellar collective session\nwith Paul Dunmall on tenor saxophone, Tony Bianco on drums and Paul Rogers on\nbass. This double disc set is made up of four lengthy performances featuring\ndifferent configurations of musicians. &quot;Trio I&quot; opens the album with the\nDean/Rogers/Bianco unit, where Dean's alto weaves notes in calamitous fashion\nalong with with brooding bowed bass and agile drumming. Rogers' dexterous bowed\nbass adds a dark texture to the music, and coupled with Bianco's unpredictable\ndrumming they make for a formidable pair. Paul Dunmall's dusky and yearning\ntenor joins the fray on &quot;Quartet&quot; using his brawny stature to develop a\nmuscular and lean approach. The music on this performance develops some very\nexciting interplay of horns with thick throbbing bass and powerfully rhythmic\ndrumming providing even more energy. Alto and tenor saxophones mix and match\nwith varying hues, creating music that is capable of ferocious power and\nintensity even thought there is little or no pre-composed material. The horns\nare stripped out on &quot;Duo&quot; leaving Rogers and Bianco to develop a bass and drums\nconversation that is very impressive in variety and elasticity of\nmovement. Things come full circle with the concluding &quot;Trio II&quot; developing an\namalgamation of the discipline and refinement that builds to a thrilling\ncollective finale.\n\n--\n\nBy John Sharpe &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/remembrance-elton-dean-paul-dunmall-paul-rogers-tony-bianco-nobusiness-records-review-by-john-sharpe.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/remembrance-elton-dean-paul-dunmall-paul-rogers-tony-bianco-nobusiness-records-review-by-john-sharpe.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Grego Applegate Edwards\n\nBy John Eyles &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.squidsear.com/cgi-bin/news/newsView.cgi?newsID=1663&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.squidsear.com/cgi-bin/news/newsView.cgi?newsID=1663&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef25dba6edd04082f6d0d96a9ed7c22a5a9f5579","amp;dn":"Elton+Dean%2C+Paul+Dunmall%2C+Paul+Rogers%2C+Tony+Bianco+-+Remembrance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef25dba6edd04082f6d0d96a9ed7c22a5a9f5579","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,37,219,166,237,208,64,130,246,208,217,106,158,215,194,42,90,159,85,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
