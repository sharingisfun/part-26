The Runaround (Andre Previn - Dory Langdon)\n6. Good And Rich (Roy Kral - Richard Druz)\n7. A Face Like Yours (Victor Feldman)\n8. Tiny Told Me (Roy Kral)\n9. Who Cares (George &amp; Ira Gershwin)\n\nJackie Cain - vocals\nRoy Kral - piano &amp; vocals\nBrian Atkinson - vibraphone\nJohn Mosher - bass\nGary Nash - drums\n\nRecorded September, 1976 at Concerts By The Sea, Redondo Beach, CA\n\n2000 Koch Jazz/Rhino\n\nOne aspect of Jackie &amp; Roy's carefully arranged music that is not often commented upon, is that Jackie &amp; Roy always bring in the jam.\n\nThis is true of their first album with Charlie Ventura's band, up until their last, the magnificent THE BEAUTIFUL SEA. Well, I haven't heard as much Jackie &amp; Roy as would like to, but I have been given no reason to assume anything else.\n\nHighlights for me on this album are MAGIC TO DO, as well as the three tracks on which Roy Kral has a composers credit. A FACE LIKE YOURS should also not be overlooked.\n\n-svidrigailovjones","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08894a44d6efff0345d72e35b1edf04538757188","amp;dn":"Jackie+%26amp%3B+Roy+-+Concerts+By+The+Sea+%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08894a44d6efff0345d72e35b1edf04538757188","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,137,74,68,214,239,255,3,69,215,46,53,177,237,240,69,56,117,113,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
