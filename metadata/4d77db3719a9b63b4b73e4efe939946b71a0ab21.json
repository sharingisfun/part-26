He has long since lost control of the class. Though more or less resigned to his lot, he occasionally loses his temper and tries to gain respect through violence. But he knows that this is not the answer. His pupils sense his insecurity and torment him in their childish way. The pressure also begins to affect MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rtenssonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s marriage. For a while, he finds solace with Ann-Marie, a teacher who possesses natural authority. When summer comes, MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rtensson tries in vain to make the children stay near the shore. He jumps into the water and swims after them. What begins as a game turns into catastrophe.In this film, Jan Troell draws upon his own experience as a teacher. As usual, he wrote the script in collaboration with producer Bengt Forslund. Clas EngstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m, author of the 1957 novel on which it is based, was also involved in the scriptwriting. All three are former teachers.The film was shot at TroellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s former school, the Sorgenfri School in MalmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶, with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrealÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ pupils and their parents, with a skeleton crew, minimal lighting and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to heighten the authenticity ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ an unobtrusive, mobile 16 mm camera.\n\nJan Troell was born in 1931 in Limhamn near MalmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ in the southern Swedish region of SkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ne. Many of his films are set in this landscape, where he worked as a teacher for nine years, while making his first short films and documentaries. TroellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s international breakthrough came with his epic film version of Wilhelm Moberg's novel, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe EmigrantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (1971) and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe New LandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (1972). Troell made his comeback as a director with his 1991 film ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIl CapitanoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a thriller about a couple on the run. In three other films Troell looks to the past.\n\nNOTE: This upload is ripped from a rather poor and worn out VHS copy, so the picture quality ranges from bad to unwatchable for the first two minutes (see last hidden screenshot), but after that the quality is acceptable or better with very occasional disturbances. \n\nSubtitles - English, Spanish\nDirector: Jan Troell\nYear: 1968\nCountry: Sweden","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d77db3719a9b63b4b73e4efe939946b71a0ab21","amp;dn":"Ole+dole+doff+%28Jan+Troell%2C+1968%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d77db3719a9b63b4b73e4efe939946b71a0ab21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,119,219,55,25,169,182,59,75,115,228,239,233,57,148,107,113,160,171,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
