CBC Music was there to capture two soulful sets of music that in many ways summed up the sense of community that made Cory WeedsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Cellar Jazz Club an artistic success from the very beginning.\n\nThe night kicked off with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love Walked InÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a George Gershwin standard that was actually the first tune ever played at the Cellar. And fittingly the recorded portion of the evening concluded with a kickinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ version of Hugh FraserÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s punchy blues, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thank You Very MuchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sung by Jennifer Scott.   \n\nPerformers\n\nMike Allen Saxes\nMiles Black Piano\nChris Davis Trumpet\nHugh Fraser Trombone and Piano\nOliver Gannon Guitar\nJulian MacDonough Drums\nDarren Radtke Bass\nJennifer Scott Vocals and Piano\nAdam Thomas Bass\nCory Weeds Saxes\nIntroductions by Margaret Gallagher\n\n00\tIntroduction\t\t1:04\n01\tLove Walked In\t\t9:31\n02\tGet Back\t\t6:41\n03\tPuttin on the Ritz\t8:32\n04\tGema\t\t\t4:53\n05\tMove Over Blues\t\t9:45\n06\tFin de l'affaire\t7:40\n07\tThank You Very Much\t6:59 \n08\tClosing Announcement\t1:03","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e59f8c04ab2daec081a669be54e7bacf6ac141b","amp;dn":"Cellar+Club+Vancouver+Final+Evening+2014-02-26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e59f8c04ab2daec081a669be54e7bacf6ac141b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,89,248,192,74,178,218,236,8,26,102,155,229,78,123,172,246,172,20,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
