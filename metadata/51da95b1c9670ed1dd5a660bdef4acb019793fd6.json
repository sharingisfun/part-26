Most of these 'secret' Museums are housed in small buildings, tucked away from the mainstream in hidden corners of our cities. The brand new and exclusive 12-part series takes viewers on a journey with enthusiastic academic and historian, Professor Ronald Hutton, to the unsung gems of British museums. Each episode features a different museum that is bursting with little known history. Professor Hutton visits little known places all over the country, including the Magic Circle museum; the Grant museum of Zoology, which houses a fascinating and macabre Victorian skeletons and remains in jars; Pollock's Toy museum; and Egyptian mummies inside the Petrie Museum.\n\n\n\n\n3)  Pollocks Toy Museum \nPollocks Toy Museum is a delicious hidden gem. It takes its name from Benjamin Pollock, the last of the Victorian Toy Theatre printers, and was set up in the 1960's by Marguerite Fawdry who, after buying up all the stock of Benjamin Pollock, slowly but surely built up one the largest collection of 19th and 20th century toys in the world. The museum is housed in two charming old buildings just north of Soho in London. It's a fascinating exhibition of miniature theatres, teddy bears, wax and china dolls, board games, mechanical toys and doll's houses. Today, the museum is still in family hands, and is run by Eddy Fawdry, Marguerite's grandson who shows Professor Hutton around. The Professor also visits The Royal Society. It was established by the Royal Charter of King Charles ll in 1663 and has been at the heart of modern science for 350 years. Some of the greatest names of our age have been active members, including Sir Isaac Newton, Robert Boyle and Sir Christopher Wren. Although it's not technically a museum, the Society have a tremendous collection of books, archives, paintings, and artefacts which are studied by scholars worldwide, some of which are put on display for the public who use the reading room.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/img96/6413/mxan.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/img96/6413/mxan.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/1524/ij6s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/1524/ij6s.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/9899/u5sf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/9899/u5sf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img541.imageshack.us/img541/3991/n9u1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img541.imageshack.us/img541/3991/n9u1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/853/chdn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/853/chdn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/2530/uxd0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/2530/uxd0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/2680/itzx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/2680/itzx.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/3971/4qgo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/3971/4qgo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img541.imageshack.us/img541/9661/ovhc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img541.imageshack.us/img541/9661/ovhc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/7534/dngb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/7534/dngb.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/3817/ydqn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/3817/ydqn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img15.imageshack.us/img15/5941/znkj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img15.imageshack.us/img15/5941/znkj.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;eaa2838d82aaa6d9c4db&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1338 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 160 Kbps CBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 25mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 12\n * Part Size: 210 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://realscreen.com/2013/04/18/yesterday-lines-up-professor-huttons-curiosities/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://realscreen.com/2013/04/18/yesterday-lines-up-professor-huttons-curiosities/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51da95b1c9670ed1dd5a660bdef4acb019793fd6","amp;dn":"Professor+Huttons+Curiosities+03of12+Pollocks+Toy+Museum+PDTV+x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51da95b1c9670ed1dd5a660bdef4acb019793fd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,218,149,177,201,103,14,209,221,90,102,11,222,244,172,176,25,121,63,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
