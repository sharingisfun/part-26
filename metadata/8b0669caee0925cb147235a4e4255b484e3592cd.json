This is NOT the musical Broadway version. The only music here is the Italian operas the opera house is performing. This version based on a stage version of the book, by noted playwright Arthur Kopit, is beautiful and well performed. I love this movie because of its character development and lack of individuals breaking into song for absolutely no reason, what so ever. The use of the Phantom's various masks to convey his mood is a very unique approach, in this film. The climatic duet between Christine and Eric and a beautiful scene with Burt Lancaster and Charles Dance (Carriere and Eric) are both very moving.\r\n\r\nA beautiful, and tragic love story","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b0669caee0925cb147235a4e4255b484e3592cd","amp;dn":"The+Phantom+of+the+opera+%281990%29+%28Burt+Lancaster%2C+Teri+Polo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b0669caee0925cb147235a4e4255b484e3592cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,6,105,202,238,9,37,203,20,114,53,164,228,37,91,72,78,53,146,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
