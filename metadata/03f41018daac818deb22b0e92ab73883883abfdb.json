A decade-long celebration of growth and power, fueled by the victory in WWII. Based on Pulitzer Prize winner David Halbertstam's bestselling book, this lively series casts a nostalgic eye back on the years of Ozzie and Harriet and the Hula Hoop, years which nonetheless paved the way for the turmoil of the decades to follow. From Sputnik to Elvis, bobby-socks to the Kinsey Report, DAVID HALBERTSTAM'S THE FIFTIES is a breathtaking collage of the people, music, memories, fads and issues that sent the first Baby Boomers on their way. Countless interviews, clips from landmark TV shows and movies and specially-produced music videos set to original '50's hits capture the intense tapestry of optimism and fear, repression and discovery that was THE FIFTIES.\n\n\nEpisode 4 - A Burning Desire\n\nSex in the 1950's! &quot;The Kinsey Report&quot; blows the lid off what Americans were REALLY doing in the bedroom. Marilyn Monroe's nude calendar photo prompts Hugh Hefner to establish his &quot;Playboy&quot; empire while Marilyn herself becomes the nation's reigning sex goddess. By the end of the decade birth control advocate Margaret Sanger and Dr. Gregory &quot;Goody&quot; Pincus bring forth &quot;The Pill&quot;, forever changing relations between men and women.\n\n\nVideo \nVHSRip\nID : 0 \nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual \nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5 \nFormat settings, BVOP : 2 \nFormat settings, QPel : No \nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints \nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263) \nCodec ID : DX50 \nCodec ID/Hint : DivX 5 \nDuration : 54mn 11s \nBit rate : 3 894 Kbps \nWidth : 640 pixels \nHeight : 480 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3 \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nCompression mode : Lossy \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.423 \nStream size : 1.47 GiB (94%) \nWriting library : XviD 73 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03f41018daac818deb22b0e92ab73883883abfdb","amp;dn":"History+Channel+-+David+Halberstam%27s+The+Fifties+%281997%29+-+Pt.+4+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03f41018daac818deb22b0e92ab73883883abfdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,244,16,24,218,172,129,141,235,34,176,233,42,183,56,131,136,58,191,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
