At their core, Green Day were simply punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs. Though their music wasn't particularly innovative, they brought the sound of late-'70s punk to a new, younger generation with Dookie, their 1994 major-label debut. Dookie sold over ten million copies, paving the way for a string of multi-platinum releases that opened the doors for a flood of American neo-punk, punk metal, and third wave ska revivalists. More than a decade later, as many of their former contemporaries settled into retirement, Green Day remained at the forefront of popular music with albums like the Grammy-winning American Idiot.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.American Idiot\n02.Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\n03.Maria\n04.Basket Case\n05.Suffocate\n06.Burnout\n07.Stuck With Me\n08.The Grouch\n09.Brain Stew\n10.Longview\n11.Warning\n12.Hitchin' A Ride\n13.Waiting\n14.Walking Alone\n15.Minority\n16.Tired Of Waiting For You\n17.When I Come Around\n18.You Lied\n19.St. Jimmy\n20.Armatage Shanks\n21.Church On Sunday\n22.J.A.R.
