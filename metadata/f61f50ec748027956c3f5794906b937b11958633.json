All the brilliant singles are here, along with the best of the album tracks together with some wonderful bonus material (such as the Kilburn &amp; the High Roads stuff).\n\nDury was a marvellously witty and perceptive lyric writer, and whilst his distinctive cockney drawl was hardly a great singing voice, it marked him as someone who was doing something completely different from everybody else. The Blockheads of course were also a great band, and again this marked Ian Dury out from the rest of the punk/new wave movementmoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f61f50ec748027956c3f5794906b937b11958633","amp;dn":"Ian+Dury+-+Reasons+To+Be+Cheerful%2C+The+Best+Of+Ian+Dury+%5B2CD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f61f50ec748027956c3f5794906b937b11958633","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,31,80,236,116,128,39,149,108,63,87,148,144,107,147,123,17,149,134,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
