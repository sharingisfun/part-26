And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s both a good and a bad thing. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good because heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Baltimore detective who has just been secretly recruited by the government to lead a new task force created to deal with the problems that Homeland Security canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t handle. This rapid-response group is called the Department of Military Sciences, or the DMS for short. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bad because his first mission is to help stop a group of terrorists from releasing a dreadful bioweapon that can turn ordinary people into zombies. The fate of the world hangs in the balance. \n\nJonathan Maberry is the New York Times best-selling and multiple Bram Stoker AwardÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning author of Ghost Road Blues, the first of a trilogy of thrillers with a supernatural bite. A professional writer and writing teacher, he has sold more than 1.000 articles, 17 nonfiction books, six novels, and two plays.
