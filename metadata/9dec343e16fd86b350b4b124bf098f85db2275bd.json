Marvel at these monstrous mechanical creations as Discovery Channel takes you through ten exciting episodes of engineering ingenuity. In Massive Engines, Chris tells us the story of the development of engine power across a range of ten different types of machine. Constantly on the move, he combines great historical anecdotes with hands-on demos and test drives to give fascinating insights into how these great machines, old and new accomplish extraordinary feats.\n\n\n1)  Diggers \nChris Barrie explores the development of digger engines from their invention in the 19th century to the monstrous models used today. Featuring the electrically powered bucket wheel excavator, and a tunnelling machine at work under the streets of Dublin.\nincluding one that weighs more than a thousand double-decker buses.\n\n2)  Racing Cars \nChris Barrie explores the evolution of the racing car engine, visiting Beaulieu to see the fastest and most powerful early racing cars\n\n3)  Rockets \nChris Barrie explores the evolution of rocket power, from the fireworks of the ancient Chinese to the monsters of the Space Race\n\n4)  Bikes \nChris Barrie explores the evolution of motorbikes, including the 1920's Brough Superior and the world-famous Harley Davidson\n\n5)  Airliners \nChris Barrie tells the story of the development of passenger aircraft\n\n6)  Pumps \nChris Barrie explores the evolution of the enormous steam engines developed during the 1880s to pump an essential supply of clean water to the public\n\n7)  Ships \nChris Barrie examines the development of marine engines, from the first crude steam ships to the huge diesel engines found on modern container ships\n\n8)  Trucks \nChris Barrie traces the development of truck engines, including the Caterpillar 789, which has a capacity of 177 tonnes\nSome of the most massive engines on our roads power huge trucks. They carry everything from beer to dangerous chemicals. Their engines are massive and dirty and Chris Barrie just loves them. From steam to awesome diesel monsters? Keep on trucking!\n\n9)  Airships \nChris Barrie tells the story of the rise and fall of airships, from the first hot air balloons of the Montgolfier brothers in the 18th century to the glory days of Count von Zeppelin's mammoth early bombers - and even bigger, ill-fated transatlantic passenger liners.\n\n10)  Trains \nChris Barrie tells the story of the development of the engine. In this programme he looks at the development of trains, including the steam train that became a symbol of 1930s luxury\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img88.imageshack.us/img88/9985/massiveenginesscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img88.imageshack.us/img88/9985/massiveenginesscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img88.imageshack.us/img88/6732/massiveenginesscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img88.imageshack.us/img88/6732/massiveenginesscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img88.imageshack.us/img88/6666/massiveenginesscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img88.imageshack.us/img88/6666/massiveenginesscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img88.imageshack.us/img88/1603/massiveenginesscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img88.imageshack.us/img88/1603/massiveenginesscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img88.imageshack.us/img88/7702/massiveenginesscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img88.imageshack.us/img88/7702/massiveenginesscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img233.imageshack.us/img233/4808/massiveenginesscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img233.imageshack.us/img233/4808/massiveenginesscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img233.imageshack.us/img233/8866/massiveenginesscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img233.imageshack.us/img233/8866/massiveenginesscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img233.imageshack.us/img233/1390/massiveenginesscreen7o.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img233.imageshack.us/img233/1390/massiveenginesscreen7o.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img233.imageshack.us/img233/2094/massiveenginesscreen8h.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img233.imageshack.us/img233/2094/massiveenginesscreen8h.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1889 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 704 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.760\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 23:20.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 10\n * Part Size: 350 MB\n * Subtitles: None\n * Ripped by: artistharry\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://videos.howstuffworks.com/science/massive-engines-videos-playlist.htm#video-32374&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://videos.howstuffworks.com/science/massive-engines-videos-playlist.htm#video-32374&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dec343e16fd86b350b4b124bf098f85db2275bd","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+Massive+Engines+02of10+Racing+Cars+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dec343e16fd86b350b4b124bf098f85db2275bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,236,52,62,22,253,134,179,80,180,177,36,191,9,143,133,219,34,117,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
