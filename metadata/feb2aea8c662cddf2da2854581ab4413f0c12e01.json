The album was released on Kim's own record label Queen Bee Entertainment and distributed by Atlantic Records. &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; debuted and peaked at #6 on the Billboard 200 charts, selling 109,000 copies in the opening week. At the time of its release, it was the first album in three years to receive a rating of 5 microphones from Hip Hop magazine The Source. The 5 Mic rating by The Source was under much controversy by hip-hop fans because although the album was highly received by other critics, it had little impact overall at the time. The Naked Truth was released at the time of Kim's sentence, in which she went to jail for perjury. Owing to this, the album received decreasing promotion. The album did disappointingly in sales, selling less than 400,000 units.\n\n   1. &quot;Intro&quot; 0:38\n   2. &quot;Spell Check&quot; 3:37\n   3. &quot;Lighters Up&quot; 4:22\n   4. &quot;Shut Up Bitch Intro&quot; 0:55\n   5. &quot;Shut Up Bitch&quot; 4:19\n   6. &quot;Whoa&quot; 4:07\n   7. &quot;Slippin&quot; 4:25\n   8. &quot;Answering Machine (Skit #1)&quot; 2:27\n   9. &quot;All Good&quot; 4:31\n  10. &quot;I Know You See Me&quot; 3:53\n  11. &quot;W.P.I.M.P.&quot; 0:30\n  12. &quot;Quiet&quot; (featuring The Game) 4:01\n  13. &quot;Durty&quot; 4:10\n  14. &quot;Answering Machine (Skit #2)&quot; 2:23\n  15. &quot;We Don't Give a Fuck&quot; (featuring Twista and Bun B) 4:20\n  16. &quot;Gimme That&quot; (featuring Maino) 4:27\n  17. &quot;Kitty Box&quot; 3:49\n  18. &quot;Kronik&quot; (featuring Snoop Dogg) 4:32\n  19. &quot;Winners and Losers&quot; 0:56\n  20. &quot;Get Yours&quot; (featuring T.I. and Sha-Dash) 4:08\n  21. &quot;Last Day&quot; 9:59\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:feb2aea8c662cddf2da2854581ab4413f0c12e01","amp;dn":"Lil%5C%27+Kim+-+The+Naked+Truth+-FLAC-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"feb2aea8c662cddf2da2854581ab4413f0c12e01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,178,174,168,198,98,205,223,45,162,133,69,129,171,68,19,240,193,46,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
