It has semi-fixed parameters, with a selection of toggle switches offering limited editing of these. It has a very fat, zappy sound, and fantastic chunky coloured controls. The filter (Traveler) is particularly interesting, with a LPF and HPF semi linked by interlocking faders.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Original waveforms and presets fully sampled\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Traveler dual filter behaviour modelled\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Polyphonic and detune modes added\n.\n\nRS202 String Machine\n\n\nDating from 1976, the RS202 is 61 note polyphonic, with Strings I, Strings II and Brass sound sources, and a split keyboard - any sound could by assigned to either section of the keyboard. The ensemble chorus effect was a key part of the sonic signature, contributing to its classic, fizzing disco string sound.The RS202 is an all time classic string machine.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Brass, String II &amp; String II settings fully sampled\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Original switch settings modelled\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ensemble detune effect modelled\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Additional filter and EGs added\n.\n\nJennings Univox\n\n\nDating from 1951, and a true oddity. The first electronic venture for Tom Jennings who later went on to create Vox amplifiers AC15, AC30 etc. The Univox was used by the Beatles during their early Cavern days in Liverpool and can be heard on Telstar by the Tornados.In about 1951/1952 the Univox took off in a big way due to its competitive price and Tom's country wide marketing program.  The first version was the J6, single keyboard model, later followed by the J10 with two rows of Tone &amp; effect tabs. All models were supplied with metal screw-on clips, to fasten it under the right hand side of a piano. Later we designed an adjustable chromed stand that enabled the user to do gigs in other locations with out having to screw on fixing brackets each time.  Most customers in those days were either Pub owners or pianists playing Pub gigs.\n\nThis particular Univox has a great pedigree as it was loaned to us by Adrian Utley from Portishead. You can read more about it on our Blog\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Every (working) switch setting fully sampled\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sampled through original Univox speaker\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Polyphonic mode added - fantastic for spooky pads\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Additional filter and EG control\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 'Knee lever' real-time MIDI control\n.\n\nSuzuki Omnichord \n\n\nIntroduced in 1981 and manufactured by the Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation. It typically features a touch plate, and buttons for major, minor, and diminished chords. This unit (belonging to Neil Davidge of Massive Attack) is a Ã¢â‚¬ËœSystem TwoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and it has a great synth tone, which sounds Ã¢â‚¬ËœcheapÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in all the right ways. You can mix two different tones, one straight, and one modulated with a basic LFO. While not sounding much like a plucked string, it does have a pure character all its own, which won it many fans, such as Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno.\n\nThis Omnichord unit loaned by Neil Davidge from Massive Attack.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Two 'voice' settings fully sampled\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Chord matrix function fully modelled\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Strum Plate - strum in real time with MIDI controller\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Detune and Width controls added\n.\n\nKorg LP10 Electronic Piano\n\n\nKorgs first ever electronic piano, the fuzzy, dreamy tones of the LP10 weren't strictly realistic, but with retro-spectacles on it has a lot of charm. With Piano, Electric piano and Clav settings and a useful shaping EQ, but no velocity sensitivity.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Piano, Clav and Electric piano settings fully sampled\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Additional detune, velocity, Filters and EG controls\n.\n\nHammond Solovox\n\n\nThe USA precurser to the Jennings Univox, produced in Canada for Hammond by the Northern Electric Company, Ontario between 1940 and 1948. A monophonic, valve driven keyboard instrument with a separate amplifier cabinet, the sound was derived from a single LC oscillator which had a frequency range of one octave. The signal from the oscillator was then passed through a series of 5 frequency dividers to create a further two octaves. On the front of the instrument there were a series of large thumb operated buttons for oscillator range (switch-able +/- 3 octaves: 'soprano', 'contralto', 'tenor', 'bass'), vibrato, attack time, 'deep tone', 'full tone', '1st voice', 2nd voice', 'brilliant' and a switch for selecting woodwind, string sound or mute.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ All 'stop' settings fully sampled\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sampled through original speaker cabinet\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Knee Volume controller modelled for real-time MIDI control\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Polyphonic mode for ancient pad sounds\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ EG and filter controls added\n\nYou can read more about the Solovox on our You can read more about the Solovox on our Blog\n.\n\nGodwin String Concert 249\n\n\nLittle known compared to the RS202 and Arp Omnis etc, but in fact this string synth has one of the most lifelike string sounds you will hear from an analogue synth. Manufactured in Italy by Sisme, it has 49 keys, 3 string sounds - Cello 16' / Viola 8' / Violin 4' controllable by faders. Its chorus and tremolo are particularly unique, adding a fabulous shimmer to the sound.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Cello, Viola and Violin settings fully sampled\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Chorus and tremolo controls modelled\n.\n\nPhilips Philicorda\n\n\nThe Philicorda is a 1960s transistor based organ that has found favour with producers in recent times ; one was used on the album Ã¢â‚¬â„¢19Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ by Adele by producer Jim Abiss. This particular unit belongs to producer Liam Howe, and has been used on records by Marina and the Diamonds, Ellie Goulding, and Cocknbullkid.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Every 'stop' setting fully sampled\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Chord function fully sampled\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Original reverb included in effects section\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Output noise with 'backdrop' functionality\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Additional filters and EGs\n.\n\nSH2000\n\n\nThe second synth ever produced by Roland (after the sh1000), it was designed to sit on top of a home organ to provide additional sounds. To that end, it is based around presets which are selected by a series of brightly coloured paddle-switches, and sounds very fat and characterful indeed. Basic filter and LFO controls are present, as well as 'growl' and 'wow' effects, which can be linked to aftertouch to give great performance potential.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ All original SH2000 presets sampled\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Original Wow setting sampled for each patch\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Full Aftertouch control\n.\n\nSynthi AKS\n\nThe EMS Synthi AKS is a legendary instrument with an illustrious history. First manufactured in 1972 by EMS in Putney, south-west London, The Synthi A was basically a portable version of EMS's famous VCS3 synthesiser, and the KS keyboard (an unplayable 30-note touchplate) was added to make the Synthi AKS. It cost Ã‚Â£420.It was quickly adopted by the likes of Brian Eno and Pink Floyd, and has been used by experimental musicians ever since. The Synthi has a unique patching system that uses a small patchbay grid. Each of the Synthi's components appear as a source and destination on the patchbay, and by placing a pin into that x-y position, you can route the signal from one component to the other. This was a very effective way to make a powerful modular system very compact.\n\n\nThe Attic features 3 different Synthi AKS instruments :\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Multisamples : chromatically tuned patches that can be layered and played polyphincally as well as monophonically.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Loops : sequence patterns generated by the Synthi and presented in Kontakt's Beat Machine mode.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ FOCUS SFX : Individual hits and sounds from the Synthi : something it excels at and the source of the real sci-fi sound. Packaged in Soniccouture's custom FOCUS interface, where sounds can be audtioned and easily mapped across the entire keyabord to be played chromatically.\n.\n\nPreset Library\n\nThe Attic features a comprehensive library of 350 presets, arranged into the following categories:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Bass\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Strings\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Keys\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Pads\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Lead\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ SFX\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5ce39afc3306b5a4b89c07fa9676dbeda6193da","amp;dn":"SonicCouture+-+The+Attic+%28+A+NATIVE+INSTRUMENTS+KONTAKT+PLAYER+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5ce39afc3306b5a4b89c07fa9676dbeda6193da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,206,57,175,195,48,107,90,75,137,192,127,169,103,109,190,218,97,147,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
