Casey says he got beat by a former Senator from Illinois. Respect your elders.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What song fell off the chart the fastest after leaving the number one position?&quot; Casey says this song went from number 1, to number 2, to number 9, to number 35, and then completely off the hot 100.\n\nA listener writes in to ask, &quot;What Broadway musical has had the most top ten hits?&quot; Casey narrows it down to &quot;most hits in the top 4.&quot;\n\n40: Sweet Surrender - Bread\n39: Me And Mrs. Jones - Billy Paul\n38: Dialogue - Chicago\n37: All The Young Dudes - Mott The Hoople\n36: Corner Of The Sky - The Jackson Five\n35: Ben - Michael Jackson\n34: Don't Do It - The Band\n33: I Believe In Music - Gallery\n32: Rockin' Pneumonia, Boogie Woogie Flu - Johnny Rivers\n31: Spaceman - Nilsson\n30: Rock 'N Roll Soul - Grand Funk Railroad\n29: SomethingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wrong With Me - Austin Roberts\n28: Claire - Gilbert O' Sullivan\n27: American City Suite - Cashman &amp; West\n26: Elected - Alice Cooper\n25: Funny Face - Donna Fargo\n24: Crazy Horses - The Osmonds\n23: Good Time Charlie's  Got The Blues - Danny O' Keefe\n22: Operator - Jim Croce\n21: It Never Rains In Southern California - Albert Hammond\n20: I'm Stone In Love With You - The Stylistics\n19: Burning Love - Elvis Presley\n18: Ventura Highway - America\n17: Thunder And Lightning - Chi Coltrane\n16: Listen To The Music - The Doobie Brothers\n15: You Ought To Be With Me - Al Green\n14: My Ding-A-Ling - Chuck Berry\n13: If You Don't Know Me By Now - Harold Melvin &amp; The Blue-Notes\n12: Garden Party - Rick Nelson\n11: If I Could Reach You - The 5th Dimension\n10: Summer Breeze - Seals &amp; Crofts\n9: Witchy Woman - Eagles\n8: Convention '72 - The Delegates\n7: Freddy's Dead - Curtis Mayfield\n6: Papa Was A Rolling Stone - The Temptations\n5: Knight's In White Satin - The Moody Blues\n4: I Am Woman - Helen Reddy\n3: I'll Be Around - The  Spinners\n2: I'd Love You To Want Me - Lobo\n1: I Can See Clearly Now - Johnny Nash\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2c52f0497a3de5304c489351328ef8223e74702","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1972_November_18th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2c52f0497a3de5304c489351328ef8223e74702","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,197,47,4,151,163,222,83,4,196,137,53,19,40,239,130,35,231,71,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
