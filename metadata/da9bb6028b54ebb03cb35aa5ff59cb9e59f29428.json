An illuminating and transformative book, and completely original in its view of the world, The Gift is cherished by artists, writers, musicians, and thinkers. It is in itself a gift to all who discover the classic wisdom found in its pages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da9bb6028b54ebb03cb35aa5ff59cb9e59f29428","amp;dn":"The+Gift%3A+Creativity+and+the+Artist+in+the+Modern+World+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da9bb6028b54ebb03cb35aa5ff59cb9e59f29428","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,155,182,2,139,84,235,176,60,179,90,165,255,89,203,158,89,242,148,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
