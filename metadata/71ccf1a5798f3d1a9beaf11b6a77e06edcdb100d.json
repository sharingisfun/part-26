Amazon offers this:\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\nFor decades, the war in Vietnam was the central drama on the stage of Southeast Asia. It was an intensely publicized war, the first television war that came roaring into the living rooms of America every night. Walter Cronkite tells the story of the long and divisive conflict as seen through the eyes of CBS News. Dan Rather, Morley Safer and Ed Bradley report the stories of American courage, failed programs, an elusive enemy and ultimately an end to a tragic war. It is all graphically shown in these superb CBS documentaries which tell the story of the most divisive war in American history and its effect on those who fought it. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71ccf1a5798f3d1a9beaf11b6a77e06edcdb100d","amp;dn":"Vietnam+War+%5B1985%5D+Walter+Cronkite%2C+CBS+News","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71ccf1a5798f3d1a9beaf11b6a77e06edcdb100d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,204,241,165,121,143,61,26,155,234,241,27,106,119,224,110,220,219,16,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
