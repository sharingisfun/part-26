The band had broken up in April 1971 due to differences between singer Paul Rodgers and bassist Andy Fraser\n\nAll members of the band made a concerted effort to work smoothly and efficiently for Kossoff's sake. For example, in a symbolic gesture all tracks were credited to every member of the band regardless of who actually wrote them.\n\nThe attitude to the songwriting was also vastly different[citation needed]; there are no outright rock songs at all, and the three songs that contain fast-paced moments all have slower, more introspective moments. Also, many fans have interpreted some of the melancholic lyrics (many of which concern people in some form of emotional distress) as referring to Kossoff.\n\nThe album was reasonably successful, peaking at #9 in the UK album charts making it their most successful UK studio album since Fire and Water. The single release &quot;Little Bit of Love&quot; reached #13; despite failing to enter the top ten it was still their third best selling single release (it would be beaten by &quot;Wishing Well&quot; the following year). The album fared less well in the US, reaching #69; this was still a significant improvement on all previous albums bar Fire and Water.\n\nHowever, problems began again when the band was then expected to tour to promote the album, as Kossoff was faced with a task for which he was not physically capable . Gigs had been disastrous, with Fraser remembering that &quot;you could see people in the audience crying for him, longing for him to be all right&quot; (quoted in Phil Sutcliffe's liner notes). Unable to continue, Fraser left the band permanently, aged just 20. Kossoff also pulled out of the tour (although not technically leaving the band) in order to seek treatment for his drug addiction \n\nDuring the period in late 1971 where the band had split, Kossoff and Kirke had formed a new band with Japanese bassist Tetsu Yamauchi and keyboard player John &quot;Rabbit&quot; Bundrick; Kirke asked them to join the tour in place of Fraser. They accepted, and soon joined the band officially.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Catch a Train&quot;   \t3:32\n02. \t&quot;Soldier Boy&quot;   \t2:51\n03. \t&quot;Magic Ship&quot;   \t5:22\n04. \t&quot;Sail On&quot;   \t3:05\n05. \t&quot;Travellin' Man&quot;   \t3:23 \t\n06. \t&quot;Little Bit of Love&quot;   \t2:34\n07. \t&quot;Guardian of the Universe&quot;   \t5:32\n08. \t&quot;Child&quot;   \t5:18\n09. \t&quot;Goodbye&quot;   \t5:05\n\nBonus Tracks\n\n    &quot;Burnin' (Molten Gold)&quot; (Kossoff) (Alternative take) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:57\n    &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot; (Jagger/Richards) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:13\n    &quot;Magic Ship&quot; (Alternative mix) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:28\n    &quot;Little Bit of Love&quot; (Alternative mix) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:37\n    &quot;Guardian of the Universe&quot; (Paul Rodgers solo version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:07\n    &quot;Child&quot; (Early mix) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:20\n\nFree:\n\n\n    Paul Rodgers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, piano\n    Paul Kossoff Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n    Andy Fraser Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar\n    Simon Kirke Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09cf4109df3c68d0901aa190f31ec24f7b52debc","amp;dn":"Free+-+Free+At+Last+%5BRemaster-Expanded%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09cf4109df3c68d0901aa190f31ec24f7b52debc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,207,65,9,223,60,104,208,144,26,161,144,243,30,194,79,123,82,222,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
