I am uploading S01E01 individually to hopefully get some feedback on quality, and maybe some tips on how rip/convert/split the video.\n\nThis DVD is 1 long video so I can only rip it into 1, 3 hour long video.\nIf you could please comment and advise me of a video splitting app for Mac? I used Quicktime to do this one which converted to .mov so I had to convert back to m4v which I assume reduces quality and I want the highest quality possible.\n\nPLEASE PROVIDE FEEDBACK, IF POSITIVE I WILL UPLOAD THE REST OF THE SERIES AND MOVIES AS I PURCHASE THEM!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86c712b8f62906ccc67e1da308b8cc38f4dabf65","amp;dn":"Dragon+Ball+Z+-+Season+1%2C+Episode+1+%5Bh.264%2Faac+-+Compatible+with","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86c712b8f62906ccc67e1da308b8cc38f4dabf65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,199,18,184,246,41,6,204,198,126,29,163,8,184,204,56,244,218,191,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
