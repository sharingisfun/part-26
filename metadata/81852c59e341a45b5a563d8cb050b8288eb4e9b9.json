The man himself emerges as one of historyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most remarkable self-creations, a prosperous lawyer who became an ascetic in a loincloth wholly dedicated to political and social action. Lelyveld leads us step-by-step through the heroicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and tragicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½last months of this selfless leaderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s long campaign when his nonviolent efforts culminated in the partition of India, the creation of Pakistan, and a bloodbath of ethnic cleansing that ended only with his own assassination.\n\nIndia and its politicians were ready to place Gandhi on a pedestal as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFather of the NationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but were less inclined to embrace his teachings. Muslim support, crucial in his rise to leadership, soon waned, and the oppressed untouchablesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for whom Gandhi spoke to Hindus as a wholeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½produced their own leaders.\n\nHere is a vital, brilliant reconsideration of GandhiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s extraordinary struggles on two continents, of his fierce but, finally, unfulfilled hopes, and of his ever-evolving legacy, which more than six decades after his death still ensures his place as IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s social conscienceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and not just IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81852c59e341a45b5a563d8cb050b8288eb4e9b9","amp;dn":"Great+Soul+-+Mahatma+Gandhi+and+His+Struggle+With+India+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81852c59e341a45b5a563d8cb050b8288eb4e9b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,133,44,89,227,65,164,91,90,86,61,140,176,80,184,40,142,180,233,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
