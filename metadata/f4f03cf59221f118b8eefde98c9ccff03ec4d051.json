After taking this course, Clasesdeguitarra wrote: &quot;Of all the courses IÃ‚Â´ve taken here, yours was the one that really got things going for me. I managed to get the bounce rate of my web site from 75% to 30% just by following some simple things I learned from you. I also started working on some video lessons for my YouTube channel and guess what: I have over 1500 subscribers in just a few months. My FB page is over 2200 just because now I design my products and the promo associated with it thinking about a better user experience.&quot;\n\nAre you a web designer or developer looking to expand your skill set to include user experience?

After taking this course, Anne Adrian Hondema wrote, &quot;This morning I took HFI's CUA-exam and I am glad to inform you that I passed! Your courses on Udemy have proven to be a good alternative for the (much more expensive) courses of HFI and I thank you for that. Okay, I did a lot of reading apart from your courses, but the general 'red route' through usability-land was very useful and provided the 'hooks' I needed to do further exploration.&quot;\n\nAre you looking to broaden your knowledge of UX or put what you know on a more formal footing? After taking this course, Matthew Magain wrote, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The depth and breadth of content covered in this course is seriously impressive.
