The DVD contains twelve music videos for the US release, and the European release includes an extra bonus video. Glenn Danzig regained the right of ownership over the music videos after winning a lawsuit against Rick Rubin. However, the R-rated version of &quot;How the Gods Kill&quot; differs slightly from that released in 1992 as part of the How the Gods Kill limited edition CD and VHS box set. According to Glenn Danzig, the earlier edit and all other music videos officially released previously by Rubin's American Recordings remain the property of the label.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. &quot;Dirty Black Summer&quot;\n02. &quot;Dirty Black Summer&quot; - Glenn Danzig performance\n03. &quot;Dirty Black Summer&quot; - Band performance\n04. &quot;How the Gods Kill&quot; - R-rated version\n05. &quot;How the Gods Kill&quot; - Band performance\n06. &quot;Sistinas&quot; (Previously unreleased)\n07. &quot;Bodies&quot; - Camera 1 (Previously unreleased)\n08. &quot;Bodies&quot; - Camera 2 (Previously unreleased)\n09. &quot;It's Coming Down&quot; - MTV version\n10. &quot;It's Coming Down&quot; - R-rated version (broadcast on The Box in 1993)\n11. &quot;It's Coming Down&quot; - Totally uncensored version\n12. &quot;Mother '93&quot; (Live) - (Live video footage and studio recorded music)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b416781381713e54ae772923ba80bed3c0bf9f96","amp;dn":"Danzig+-+Archive+De+La+Morte+-+2003+%28DVD5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b416781381713e54ae772923ba80bed3c0bf9f96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,22,120,19,129,113,62,84,174,119,41,35,186,128,190,211,192,191,159,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
