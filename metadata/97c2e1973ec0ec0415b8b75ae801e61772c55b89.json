McCoy started out with Johnny &quot;Hammond&quot; Smith in 1961, then released seven albums for Prestige Records and then one in 1971 for the short-lived Cobblestone Records. Before disappearing from jazz.\n\nA striking little set from vibesman Freddie McCoy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not just for the cool superhero image on the front cover, but also for the tight grooves underneath! The album's one of McCoy's most unified for Prestige Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as all tracks feature a core quartet with Freddie on vibes, Charlie Wilson on piano, Steve Davis on bass, and Rudy Lawless on drums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not your usual Prestige players, and all musicians who really make the album sparkle! There's a bold soul jazz vibe running through the set Ã¢â‚¬â€œ similar to some of Freddie's other work, but a bit more open too Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and titles include a groovy take on &quot;Girl From Ipanema&quot;, plus the soul jazz classics &quot;Speak Out, Deagan!&quot; and &quot;Hav' Mercy&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as well as the cuts &quot;Yesterdays&quot; and &quot;Spider Man&quot;.\nThis is the second album recorded by McCoy.-\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Hav' Mercy\n02 - Yesterdays\n03 - The Girl From Ipanema\n04 - Spider Man\n05 - That's All\n06 - Speak Out Deagan\n\n*2012 Universal Japan / Prestige | UCCO-90112\n\nPersonnel:\nFreddie McCoy - vibes\nCharlie Wilson - piano\nSteve Davis - bass\nRudy Lawless - drums\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
