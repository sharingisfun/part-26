Many of the bands on this dvd are cult classics, now broken up, and Drive-Thru Records is on an indefinite hiatus. Before the Fueled By Ramen Records phenomenon, there was DRIVE-THRU, this label was one of the first independent labels to SUCCESSFULLY market all of their bands together.\n\nThey did long, hard, and grueling tour schedules with the bands on their roster, many of these bands left the record label shortly before breaking up, some of them still were legally obligated to keep a Drive-Thru Symbol on their discs for years after splitting with the label. This makes me wonder if the label was too hard on their bands, leaving them with scars or something...\n\nI also have the 2nd Volume as well, and if this torrent gets enough people interested i it I may upload that one too.\n\nAs for the quality of the video Much of the DVD was filmed on the band\\'s home video cameras, and by roadies and such so for shaky scenes in interviews you can\\'t expect cinema quality, I did however up the audio quality of this rip as high as I could seeing as how it\\'s all about the MUSIC on it. The Video quality is as good as it will ever get due to much of it being home recorded by the label &amp; bands. I did try to make it as clear as possible without going overboard. The music Videos were my focus on getting it as clear as it needed to be. I have played it back on VLC and it looks the same quality as directly from the disc. The DVD is old school and fullscreen, I kept the ratios. I hope you enjoy it, as it has entertained me since 2002. Yeah I take good care of my belongings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:100f27dcdd310bdddb118028d255c6c87eddbc5d","amp;dn":"Drive+Thru+Records+DVD+Volume+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"100f27dcdd310bdddb118028d255c6c87eddbc5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,15,39,220,221,49,11,221,219,17,128,40,210,85,198,200,126,221,188,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
