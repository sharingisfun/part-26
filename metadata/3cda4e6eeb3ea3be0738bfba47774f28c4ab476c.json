Yet liquidity remains fuzzy even at a conceptual level, and liquidity risk management an emerging discipline.\n\nLiquidity Modelling by Robert Fiedler is a guide on how to model and manage liquidity risk for financial market practitioners.\n\nThe authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s practical approach equips the reader with the tools to understand the components of liquidity risk, how they interact and, as a result, to build a quantitative model to display, measure and limit risk.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n1 Introduction\n\nWhat is this book about?\nIlliquidity risk: a risk type of its own?\nMeasuring illiquidity risk: what is the problem?\nComparing the measurement of liquidity and other risks\nWhat is covered by this book?\n2 Setting the Scene: Why Liquidity Is Important in a Bank\n\nBanks, financial transactions and balance sheets\nIncome, expense and earnings\nThe time value of payments\nCapital\nValue, risk and capital\nConclusions\n3 What Is Liquidity Risk?\n\nIlliquidity\nInsolvency and illiquidity\nLiquidity risk of financial instruments and markets\nLiquidity of markets for central bank funds\nLiquidity-induced value risk\nCapital as a buffer for liquidity risk?\nConclusions\n4 Illiquidity Risk: The Foundations of Modelling\n\nDescribing the bankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s balance sheet\nMeasuring illiquidity risk\nConclusion\n5 Capturing Uncertainties\n\nStationary modelling\nDynamic modelling and hypothetical transactions\nThe role of optionality\nModelling optionality\nConclusions\n6 A Template for an Illiquidity Risk Solution\n\nScenarios\nTechnical implementation\nInventories and flows\nInventories and flows of transactions\nTaxonometry\nConclusion\n7 The Counterbalancing Capacity\n\nLiquidity risk requirements\nCBC: The problem\nFLE and CBC\nBuilding blocks of a technical solution\nSolving the problem for classes of securities\nFurther issues regarding the CBC\nConclusions\n8 Intra-Day Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk and intra-day liquidity risk\nThe measurement of liquidity risk\nThe payment process\nMeasurement of ILR within an enhanced FLE or separately?\nILRS that could be measured with an enhanced FLE\nILRS that go beyond the enhanced FLE\nOther issues\nRisks related to correspondent banks\nIdiosyncratic risks of the payment processes\nMitigation of liquidity risks\nConclusion\n9 Liquidity Transfer Pricing and Limits\n\nBasic transfer-pricing concepts\nDeterministic costs of the replicating transaction\nTransfer pricing of risk\nSummary of the pricing components\nLiquidity risk limits\nRegulatory requirements\nConclusions\n10 The Basel III Banking Regulation\n\nLiquidity risk in Basel III\nThe liquidity coverage ratio\nHow can a bank improve its LCR?\nThe net stable funding ratio\nHow can a bank steer its NSFR?\nConclusions\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nRobert Fiedler\nRobert owns and runs Liquidity Risk Corp. which consults on methodology and processes and as well builds prototypes and IT solution for liquidity risk.\n\nIn the first half of his career, Robert spent over a decade in the treasury/dealing rooms of numerous international major banks as a money market liquidity manager, trading interest rate products and derivatives. Later he switched to risk management and developed Deutsche Bank GroupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s liquidity risk methodology on which he successfully built a global system (LiMA) which measures and limits the bankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funding liquidity. Moving into software development, Robert became Country Co-ordinator for Germany and Executive Director of ALM and Liquidity Risk Solutions at Algorithmics Inc., Toronto. Subsequently he joined the board of Fernbach Software, Luxemburg where he oversaw the development of ALM, performance measurement, IFRS and liquidity risk software. During this time he constantly developed liquidity methodologies and teached his research results. Jointly with the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland he developed a stochastic model which optimises the risk and return of investing Non-Maturing Assets and Liabilities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cda4e6eeb3ea3be0738bfba47774f28c4ab476c","amp;dn":"Liquidity+Modelling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cda4e6eeb3ea3be0738bfba47774f28c4ab476c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,218,78,110,235,62,163,190,7,56,191,186,71,119,79,40,196,171,71,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
