The 26 books are about a different planet where women are slaves. These books are not for the faint of heart. There is explicit sexuality and women have no rights. The books are pretty controversial and written in the 60's or 70's, I believe. If you're a feminist, you don't want to read these books.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d58fbce278a2deeec10a6f45d3b0d6bfa5bb517e","amp;dn":"John+Norman%2C+Books+of+Gor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d58fbce278a2deeec10a6f45d3b0d6bfa5bb517e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,143,188,226,120,162,222,238,193,10,111,69,211,176,214,191,165,187,81,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
