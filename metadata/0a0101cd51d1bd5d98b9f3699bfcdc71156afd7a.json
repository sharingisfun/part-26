Enter the Deep Dungeons of Doom if you dareÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nThis game is only for the brave. Dungeons await, each one deeper, each one more perilous and each one more challenging than the last.\nYou will meet monsters and you will need skill and tactics to defeat them. You will find weird and wonderful treasures along the way. Most will help you, but some might not. You may choose to play as a Crusader, a Witch or a Mercenary Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in fact each one might well be required if you are to successfully complete your quest Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but knowing when to use each one is something you are going to have to figure out for yourself.\nThe reward for your endeavours? The Deepest Dungeon of Doom. Never before has such evil existed on such a massive scale. Only the most battle-hardened rogues will stand a chance of making an impact.&quot;\n\nGame features:\n- Relive the 8-bit era with super-stylised visuals, music and SFX\n- Simple gameplay with a wicked learning curve\n- Choose from 3 characters, each with their own unique abilities\n- Battle monsters in increasingly deep and difficult dungeons\n- Explore a world of magic, evil, power and redemption\n\nUpdate 1 changelog:\n- Music no longer stops playing after shrines when you have used a revenge\n- The Merciful Blow achievement is now fixed\n- Ranged attacks will no longer be able to kill a player while the Dungeon Bonuses are on screen\n- The descriptions for both Hynx's Staff and Airmid's Dirk now fit in the stash text box\n- There is now a windowed mode!
