We are mainly focused on the Sino-sphere and East Asia, but also seeking to tweak regions like South East Asia, Mongolia and Central Asia. \n\nAs many may have noticed for long, China (Ming) and the rest of East Asia in current vanilla game has room for improvements. And our goal is to create a more immersive and historically rich experience for East Asian nation gameplay. \n\nOur first and the most important aim is to make Ming more interesting to play: We are in the process of improving not only China but also its neighbors in order to represent the Sino-sphere in a more historically plausible way. Our design philosophy is to make the mod vanilla friendly and balanced (no total overhaul done here). Sort of an unofficial DLC, so to speak. \n\nThe mod is already fully playable in its current status, but we are constantly improving it and adding new features/contents. \n\nWe kindly invite you to try Pax Sinica out and let us know where we could make even further improvements. We welcome any sort of suggestions and advices, please donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hesitate to give feedback! \n\nFeatures: \n\n1. Historically Accurate Map and Countries \nMing, South East Asia Map overhauled. \n- new provinces \nMore than 15 new provinces added to the game, providing a more historically immersive look to Ming, Korea, Ryukyu and other regions. \n- corrected borders \nAll provinces in China proper (Ming) and South East Asia now have historically correct borders. \n- new sub regions \nMing China is divided into many sub regions for missions, decisions and events. \n- new cultures \nChinese ethnic groups tweaked. The big Cantonese area is gone. \n- new countries \nSeveral Japanese new daimyos are added on the map. Chinese princely states and Tamna in Jeju are releasable. \nYou can also form Yuan, Mongol Empire a la Ghengis Khan and Goguryeo via decisions. \n\n2. Events \nMany new Dynamic Historical Events (DHE) for China, Japan and other Asian countries. The descriptions and effects of vanilla events are also tweaked for better output. \n- Chinese Events \nMore faction events added. The late Ming period has more troubles in order to make the game play as Ming more challenging. \n- Japanese Events \nNew Daimyos in the 16th and 17th centuries such as Oda and Tokugawa will rise as in real life history and old big clans like Hosokawa or Yamana will get serious internal problems like they had in real history. \n- Other Asian countries \nMongol, Oirats, Tibet, Dai Viet, Shan and Taungu get more love. \n\n3. Game Mechanics and New Systems \nPax Sinica has changed vanilla systems and added completely new game designs. However, we try to keep them simple as possible, so there is no need to read another manual! \n- Tweaked Faction System \nAhistorical temple faction is removed and an Emperor faction is added. The effects of each faction are also tweaked and more enjoyable now. \n- Transition of the Celestial Empire \nThe holder of the Celestial Empire could be changed by wars. The holder has some bonus to govern China more easily. \n- Tributary System \nMing or other states having the government Celestial Empire can build tributary relations with neighboring countries. This tributary relationship gives benefits on the both sides. \n- Administrative capacity system for big countries \nNot only Ming, but also other big countries get some (not too harsh) penalties according to their monthly income and tech levels. During the technological advance, these penalities will be removed.\n- Shogunate System \nThe Japanese Shogun and daimyos now have decisions about reforms in order to expand the territory in Japan. We won't have ahistorically united Japan in the 16th century now. \n\n4. Other Changes \nA lot of small additions. \n- National Ideas \nSay goodbye to the old unhistorical Ming Ideas, Pax Sinica has a better one. \nSome Japanese clans have original national ideas. \n- A New Government \nTibet has now unique government Tibetan Theocracy. \n- New Decisions \nThere are many cultural and political decisions. \n- SEA Unit Graphics \nPax Sinica includes Rasiya's SEA Unit Graphics Mod. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c730c2042c0b2a85bef66892e84a0b48a5983411","amp;dn":"Pax+Sinica+EU4+mod+version+1.13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c730c2042c0b2a85bef66892e84a0b48a5983411","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,48,194,4,44,11,42,133,190,246,104,146,232,74,11,72,165,152,52,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
