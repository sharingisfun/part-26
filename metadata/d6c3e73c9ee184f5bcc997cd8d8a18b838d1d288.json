But she never expected him to change the locks on their Chicago penthouse, cancel her credit cards, and disappear with their two boys. Now sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s literally on the streets with her elderly mother, her momÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dog ... and $220 to her name.\n\nThank goodness she has somewhere to goÃ¢â‚¬â€Manna House, the women's shelter where she works. But even in the bustling shelterÃ¢â‚¬â€surrounded by residents and the Yada Yada Prayer GroupÃ¢â‚¬â€Gabby feels more alone than ever. She longs for someone she can really talk to, someone to help mend together the pieces of her broken life. Her warm-hearted lawyer seems ready to offer more than legal counsel ... but is he the answer to prayer or just a pleasant distraction?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6c3e73c9ee184f5bcc997cd8d8a18b838d1d288","amp;dn":"+Neta++Jackson-Who+Do+I+Talk+To+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6c3e73c9ee184f5bcc997cd8d8a18b838d1d288","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,195,231,60,158,225,132,245,188,201,151,205,141,138,24,184,56,209,210,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
