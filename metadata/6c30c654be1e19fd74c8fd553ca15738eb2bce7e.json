Moore (January 3rd 2012)\n\nEven a vampire has to face her inner demonsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nKat Redding is the very thing she hunts: a vampire, thirsting for blood, capable of killing any creature unlucky enough to get in her path. The difference is, Kat kills her own kind in order to protect human Purebloods. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good at what she does. Good enough to earn the nickname Lady DeathÃ¢â‚¬â€and the enmity of every bloodthirsty being around. But now a vampire Count is intent on merging his House with a werewolf cult to create a force of terrifying power.\n\nKat can't allow that to happen. Even if it means taking on a den of weres and a vampire more ruthless than any sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s encountered before. She has the weapons, the skill, and a few allies. But that may not be enough to eliminate the Count before her own dark nature rises to the surfaceÃ¢â‚¬â€and costs her whatever is left of her humanityÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nBook 2: Tainted Night, Tainted Blood (Kat Redding #2) by E.S. Moore (July 3rd 2012) \n\nKat Redding is a vampire with a job to do, wiping out the vamps and werewolves who prey on Pureblood humans. Suddenly Kat, also known as Lady Death, has competition, and it's causing problems. Vampire houses and werewolf clans alike are blaming her for a spate of gruesome murders, and Kat needs to figure out who's really responsible before she becomes the next target. On the hunt, she forms an uneasy alliance with both the Luna Cult and a powerful rogue werewolf. But the truths Kat's uncovering - about her enemies and her few remaining confidantes - are far from comforting. And when the chance comes to leave her life of vengeance behind, Kat must decide whether her real motive lies in protecting the innocent, or sating her own fierce hungers.\n\nBook 3: Blessed by a DemonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mark (Kat Redding #3) by E.S. Moore (December 31st 2012) \n\nIn a job like this, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no retirement plan\n\nKat ReddingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life is dangerous enough when sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hunting the rogue vampires who prey on Pureblood humans. But now that Kat is thinking of getting out of the killing business, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faced with a slew of new problems. Like the demon Beligral, who offers help at an escalating cost, and the werewolf cult with whom sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entwined professionally and personally. And then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Countess BasetÃ¢â‚¬â€the terrifying vampire who wants Kat to become her personal assassin.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no wonder that Kat has been seeking refuge in the mysterious town known as Delai, a place where she can shed her Lady Death persona and live a life thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as close to normal as sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever known. But even in this haven, something feels askew. Delai is a little too serene. And the more she discovers, the more Kat realizes that the only choice left to her is not whether to do battle, but which side sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll risk her life to defendÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c30c654be1e19fd74c8fd553ca15738eb2bce7e","amp;dn":"Kat+Redding+Series+%281-3%29+by+E.S.+Moore+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c30c654be1e19fd74c8fd553ca15738eb2bce7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,48,198,84,190,30,25,253,116,200,253,85,60,161,87,56,235,43,206,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
