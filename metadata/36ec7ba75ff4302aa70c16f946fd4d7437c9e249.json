It should force the Saidists to acknowledge the sophistry of their false prophet.&quot;\n\nMIDDLE EAST QUARTERLY\n\n&quot;Ibn Warraq has written a brilliant and luminous book of cultural analysis and intellectual history. He reminds us of so many precious things in the West - and of it - that are worth upholding in the face of critics who enjoy Western liberties and denigrate them at the same time. This is more than a demolition of Edward Said's Orientalism: In its own right, it is an exquisite inquiry into the great ideas at play in our world.&quot;\n\nFOUAD AJAMI\nProfessor at The Johns Hopkins University\nSchool of Advanced International Studies\nAuthor of The Foreigner's Gift: The Americans, the Arabs\nand the Iraqis in Iraq\n\n\n&quot;For decades Edward Said enjoyed the best that Western academic life had to offer - international celebrity, plaudits, honors and fame beyond the wildest dreams of most professors - while constantly bashing the history, values, and policies that have made this privileged existence possible. In Defending the West the eminent intellectual Ibn Warraq exposes with razor sharp precision the hypocrisy of Said's writings as well as the perverted academic culture that has made his great success possible. With this important new book Ibn Warraq has once and for all dispatched Orientalism to the dustbin of history.&quot;\n\nEFRAIM KARSH\nHead of Mediterranean Studies, University of London\nAuthor of Empires of the Sand and Islamic Imperialism: A History ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36ec7ba75ff4302aa70c16f946fd4d7437c9e249","amp;dn":"Defending+the+West_+A+Critique+of+Edward","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36ec7ba75ff4302aa70c16f946fd4d7437c9e249","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,236,123,167,95,244,48,42,167,12,22,249,70,253,77,116,55,201,226,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
