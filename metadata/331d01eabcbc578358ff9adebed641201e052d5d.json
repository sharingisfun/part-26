It is written in a way that is equally applicable to the USA and UK (where there are slightly different building regulations) and deals with matters that are basic to building and commissioning any amateur observatory. Uniquely, David Arditti also considers the aesthetics of amateur observatories ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ fitting them in with family and neighbors, and maybe disguising them as more common garden buildings if necessary. Every amateur astronomer who wants a purpose-built observatory (and letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s face it, which one of them doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t?) will find this book invaluable.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 256 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1 edition (December 17, 2007)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0387345213\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0387345215","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:331d01eabcbc578358ff9adebed641201e052d5d","amp;dn":"Setting+Up+a+Small+Observatory+-+From+Concept+to+Construction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"331d01eabcbc578358ff9adebed641201e052d5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,29,1,234,188,188,87,131,88,255,154,222,190,214,65,32,30,5,45,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
