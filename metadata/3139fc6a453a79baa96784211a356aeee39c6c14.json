He lives in Wellington County, Ontario.\n\nEarly life\nHe was born Charles Thomas Connors (known as Tommy Messer) in Saint John, New Brunswick to the teenaged Isabel Connors and her boyfriend Thomas Sullivan. He was a cousin of New Brunswick fiddling sensation, Ned Landry. He spent a short time living with his mother in a low-security women's penitentiary before he was seized by Children's Aid Society and was later adopted by the Aylward family in Skinners Pond, Prince Edward Island.\nAt the age of 13 he left his adoptive family to hitchhike across Canada, a journey that consumed the next 13 years of his life as he travelled between various part-time jobs while writing songs on his guitar. At his last stop in Timmins, Ontario, which may also have been his big &quot;break&quot;, he found himself a nickel short of a beer at the city's Maple Leaf Hotel. The bartender, Gaet Lepine, agreed to give Tom a beer if he would play a few songs. These few songs turned into a 13-month contract to play at the hotel, a weekly spot on the CKGB radio station in Timmins, eight 45-RPM recordings, and the end of the beginning for Tom Connors.\n\n\n\n\n\nMusical career \n\nDuring the mid-1970s, Connors wrote and recorded &quot;The Consumer&quot;, an ode to bill-paying that became the theme song for the popular Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) consumer affairs program, Marketplace. For the first few seasons, Connors appeared in the opening credits of the program, before &quot;The Consumer&quot; was replaced as the theme ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ initially by an instrumental background version and ultimately by another piece of music entirely.\n\nIn 1974 Tom had a mini-series running on CBC Television in which he met and exchanged with folks from all across Canada. The series called &quot;Stompin Tom's Canada&quot; was co-produced with the help of CBC and ran for 26 episodes of 30 minutes each.\n\nTypically writing about Canadian lore and history, some of Connors' better-known songs include &quot;Bud the Spud&quot;, &quot;Big Joe Mufferaw&quot;, &quot;The Black Donnellys&quot;, &quot;The Martin Hartwell Story&quot;, &quot;Reesor Crossing Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Sudbury Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;The Hockey Song&quot; (aka &quot;The Good Old Hockey Game&quot;); the last is frequently played over sound systems at National Hockey League (NHL) games.\n\nInterestingly, Tom has never lost touch with Gaet Lepine, the bartender he befriended in Timmins. In fact, over the years, the two have co-written many songs together. These songs are featured in Stompin' Tom's 250 Songs songbook.\n\nThe song that Tom wrote the fastest was Maritime Waltz; time, 12 minutes.[1]\n\n \n\n\nNickname \n\nConnors' habit of stomping the heel of his left boot to keep rhythm earned him the nickname &quot;that stompin' guy&quot;, or &quot;Stomper&quot;. It wasn't until Canada's 100th birthday, July 1, 1967, that the name Stompin' Tom Connors was first used, when Boyd MacDonald, a waiter at the King George Tavern in Peterborough, Ontario introduced Tom on stage.[2] Based on an enthused audience reaction to it, Tom had it officially registered in Ontario as Stompin' Tom Ltd. the following week. Various stories have circulated about the origin of the foot stomping, but it's generally accepted that he did this to keep a strong tempo for his guitar playing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ especially in the noisy bars and beer joints where he frequently performed. After numerous complaints about damaged stage floors, Tom began to carry a piece of plywood that he stomped even more vigorously than before. The &quot;stompin' &quot; board has since become one of his trademarks. After stomping a hole in the wood, he would pick it up and show it to the audience (accompanied by a joke about the quality of the local lumber) before calling for a new one. It was reported that when asked about his &quot;stompin' board&quot;, Tom replied, &quot;it's just a stage I'm going through&quot;. Stompin' Tom periodically auctions off his &quot;stompin' boards&quot; for charity with the latest board selling for over $14,000.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetirement and nationalistic protest \n\nAs the 1970s progressed, he retired to his farm in Norval, near Georgetown, Ontario, to protest the lack of support given to Canadian stories by the policies of the Federal government, particularly the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). He also boycotted the Juno Awards in protest of the qualification guidelines set by the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS) for possible nominees who were being consistently nominated and awarded outside of their musical genre. He strongly opposed artists who conducted most of their business in the United States being nominated for Junos in Canada. Connors, who referred to these particular artists as &quot;turncoat Canadians&quot;, felt that in view of the fact that they had chosen to live and work in the U.S., it was only fair that they competed with Americans for Grammy Awards, and left the Juno competition to those who lived and conducted business in Canada.\n\nHis protest caught national attention when he sent back his six Junos accompanied by a letter to the board of Directors.\n\n&quot;Gentlemen:I am returning herewith the six Juno awards that I once felt honored to have received and which, I am no longer proud to have in my possession. As far as I am concerned you can give them to the border jumpers who didn't receive an award this year and maybe you can have them presented by Charley Pride. I feel that the Junos should be for people who are living in Canada, whose main base of business operations is in Canada, who are working toward the recognition of Canadian talent in this country and who are trying to further the export of such talent from this country to the world with a view to proudly showing off what this country can contribute to the world market. Until the academy appears to comply more closely with aspirations of this kind, I will no longer stand for any nominations, nor will I accept any award given. Yours very truly, Stompin' Tom Connors[citation needed]\n\nHe remained in retirement for 12 years before persistent love from young roots revivalists drew him back into the studio and on to the stage. To this day, Stompin' Tom's performances remain popular, and he remains one of Canada's more prolific recording artists. His songs often pay tribute to Canadian newsmakers or personalities, and can be topical, referring to news events of the day. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Proud Canadian 1990 (reissued 2009)\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nBud The Spud\nThe Hockey Song (2008 version)\nSnowmobile Song\nRoll on Saskatchewan\nManitoba\nSudbury Saturday Night\nTo It and At It\nTillsonburg\nRoving All Over The Land\nNew Brunswick and Mary\nBig Joe Mufferaw\nGumboot Cloggeroo (Gumboot ClogginÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢)\nThe Old Atlantic Shore\nBlue Nose\nFleur De Lis\nMargoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Cargo\nThe Ketchup Song\nTribute to Wilf Carter\nThe Bridge Came TumblinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Down\nMarten Hartwell Story\nI am the Wind\nThe Singer (voice of the people)\nCanada Day, Up Canada Way\nThe Olympic Song (new 2008 version)\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3139fc6a453a79baa96784211a356aeee39c6c14","amp;dn":"Stompin%5C%27+Tom+Conners+-+A+Proud+Canadian+2009+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3139fc6a453a79baa96784211a356aeee39c6c14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,57,252,106,69,58,121,186,169,103,132,33,26,53,106,238,227,156,108,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
