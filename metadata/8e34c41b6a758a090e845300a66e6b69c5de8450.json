Titanic's sinking from the standpoint of 2nd Officer Charles Herbert Lightoller, himself the most senior of the ill-fated ship's Deck Officers to survive the disaster. (Lightoller later went on to distinguish himself as a line British Naval Officer during the First World War and served as a Senior Naval Staff Officer (convoys) during WWII. Between wars he owned and operated a successful family business producing pleasure craft.) His own survival of the sinking, along with several others, is shown atop one of the liner's two &quot;collapsible&quot; lifeboats which was capsized in floating off the liner as it sank. The picture depicts then known facts (c1958) as reported after the sinking; such as the woeful lack of adequate lifeboats, the ship's band playing true to the very end, White Star's co-owner Bruce Ismay's somewhat less than chivalrous departure from the sinking vessel.\n\nSinopse Pt Br:\n\nConta a histÃƒÂ³ria do navio RMS Titanic, o maior, mais veloz, mais luxuoso e mais seguro transatlÃƒÂ¢ntico do mundo, cuja jornada sairia de Southampton, na Inglaterra, para Nova York, nos Estados Unidos. Mas apÃƒÂ³s quatro noites navegando pelo oceano, o navio cruza tragicamente com um gigantesco iceberg, vitimando 1.500 passageiros, sendo que pouco mais de 700 sobreviveram.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e34c41b6a758a090e845300a66e6b69c5de8450","amp;dn":"A+Night+To+Remember+%5BKenneth+More+%5D+%281958%29+DVDRip+Oldies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e34c41b6a758a090e845300a66e6b69c5de8450","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,52,196,27,106,117,138,9,14,132,83,0,166,110,107,105,197,222,132,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
