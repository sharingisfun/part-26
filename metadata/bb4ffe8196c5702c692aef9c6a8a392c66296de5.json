Once identified, classified and explained, these errors can be tackled and eliminated to enhance spoken and written fluency in the language.Learning a foreign language can be likened to a journey through a maze of errors. Errare (to err in Latin) is what the student must do in order to learn. Like a knight errant, riding through a dark forest full of wrong turns and dead ends before finally coming out into a clearing, the willing learner confronts error in order to become free of it. There is no learning without making mistakes. Mistakes are a key element on the road to mastery since they lead to correction, understanding, and ultimately self-correction.Some of the common errors we have identified in this book deal with gender and number, accentuation, spelling and capitalization; others highlight false cognates, idiomatic expressions and non-existent words. These errors all reflect misconceptions about the structure of the Spanish language in contrast to English. To help English-speaking students, we have highlighted similarities and differences between English and Spanish, and set down some simple rules. By following these rules, the student will make better connections and associations, and thus gain a deeper knowledge and understanding of both languages.In order to assist students in achieving mastery in Spanish, we also offer a variety of mnemonic devices and practical shortcuts for remembering both grammar rules and vocabulary. We hope that they will add enjoyment to the process and encourage the development of personal learning strategies.To effectively practice and drill the material presented, each chapter contains a variety of exercises as well as an answer key in the appendix. To ensure that students also receive the benefits provided by new technologies and interactive learning, the book is accompanied by audio files and supplementary exercises   made available on the Speed Up Your Spanish companion website, www.speedupyourspanish.com.Chapter 1 deals with the number and gender of nouns, stressing the importance of gender in Spanish in contrast to English. It indicates numerous exceptions and suggests strategies for remembering the gender of words that tend to cause problems for English speakers. The purpose of this chapter is to show how correct usage of gender will enable the student to make the proper agreement among the different elements of a sentence, thus leading to improved accuracy both in writing and speaking. This chapter also teaches how to distinguish between words that look similar, but have very different meanings due to their gender, e.g., el puerto (port) and la puerta (door); el capital (money) and la capital (capital of a country), etc. Examples of gender affecting meaning are not usually covered by Spanish textbooks, but they are required knowledge for intermediate-level Spanish students.The next three chapters deal with Ã¢â‚¬Ëœfalse friends,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ also known as false cognates. Given the relevance and breadth of this linguistic phenomenon, we have subdivided it into categories and chapters that deal separately with verbs, nouns, and adjectives and adverbs. Our method is to create awareness of the similarity in form between an English and a Spanish word, while demonstrating the difference in meaning. From our experience of teaching English speakers, we know that this is a key area of misunderstanding, and one that has been neglected by traditional grammar texts. Therefore students will find it of particular value.Chapter 2 highlights false cognate verbs by demonstrating and explaining their different meanings. This is complemented, where appropriate, with useful expressions that help to reinforce the meaning of these verbs.Chapter 3 presents false cognate nouns and their usage. It complements the explanations with related expressions. In addition to learning which nouns to use, students will benefit from learning related nouns and synonyms, thereby expanding their vocabulary.Chapter 4 deals with false cognate adjectives and adverbs, and also includes related expressions to help emphasize the meaning of each word. Synonyms are also presented to help broaden studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ vocabulary.Chapter 5 clarifies the variations and shades of meaning of certain Spanish verbs, as well as other words that appear to be similar yet have different meanings. Some of these verbs are differentiated by their prefixes, e.g., seguirÃ¢â‚¬â€œ conseguirÃ¢â‚¬â€œperseguirÃ¢â‚¬â€œproseguir.Chapter 6 contains expressions organized by semantic field, e.g., caer, haber, tener, etc. We stress how important it is for students to master an array of such expressions that cannot be translated literally, but are an essential element of everyday communication.Chapter 7 covers non-existent words, words with double meanings and other misused expressions that are often a result of linguistic transfer from English. The aim of this chapter is two-fold: to eliminate such non-existent words or expressions from the studentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s repertoire; and to highlight words with double meanings. Thus by learning correct usage, students can consolidate their knowledge of the language while expanding their vocabulary.Chapter 8 deals with rules of tonic and written accentuation. This is an important aspect of the language, not often taught in a focused manner, but very relevant to both written and spoken Spanish. Students can practice Spanish accentuation on the companion website and listen to interactive exercises designed for this purpose.Chapter 9 deals with spelling, punctuation and capitalization. These aspects of the language are not easily mastered, yet are very important in written Spanish. Contrary to popular opinion, Spanish is not a simple phonetic language that is written as it is spoken. This chapter identifies letter combinations that do not exist in Spanish, while highlighting those that are frequently used. Once students become aware of the writing conventions in Spanish (in some cases considerably different from English), they are able to enhance their writing skills. This chapter comes with audio files on the companion website, so that students can listen to audio clips and put into practice what they have learned.Answers to the exercises contained in each chapter can be found in the Appendix.It is our conviction, as authors of Speed Up Your Spanish, that we are providing students with a rich and invaluable repertoire of words and expressions that will facilitate, if not ensure, a mastery of Spanish. Our hope is that by focusing on the content of each chapter and doing the exercises, students will feel empowered not only to tackle their own common errors and the difficult aspects of the language, but to immerse themselves in the rich and diverse Hispanic culture","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb4ffe8196c5702c692aef9c6a8a392c66296de5","amp;dn":"Speed+Up+Your+Spanirategies+to+avoid+common+errors.+Javier+Mu%26nt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb4ffe8196c5702c692aef9c6a8a392c66296de5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,79,254,129,150,197,112,44,105,42,239,156,106,138,57,44,102,41,109,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
