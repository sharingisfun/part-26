We do this by providing a philosophical toolkit, as well as a framework for considering the principal areas of philosophy. Ancient Greek philosophers had a concept they called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“areteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. It is often translated as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“excellenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“virtueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, but Brian Johnson of ThinkArete says itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s better defined as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“constantly striving to reach your highest potential.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ This manifesto will bring you closer to arete.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nMore Info:\n\nJoshua Goldman and Jason Shen both studied biology at Stanford University.
