ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s famously simple to build a basic Rails application. Once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve started down the track, however, you discover that Rails is a powerful, deep, and rich full-stack platform capable of tackling virtually any development challenge.\nRails 4 in Action is a fully-revised second edition of Rails 3 in Action. This hands-on, comprehensive introduction to Rails gives readers everything they need to become competent and confident Rails developers.
