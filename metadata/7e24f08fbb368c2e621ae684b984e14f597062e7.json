They formed in 1974, and are best known for their 1984 single &quot;Rock You.&quot; The original lineup was formed by drummer Bruce Arnold, and consisted of lead vocalist Brian Vollmer, guitarists Ron Watson and Rick &quot;Minstrel&quot; Trembley, keyboardist Don Simmons, and bassist Keith &quot;Bert&quot; Zurbrigg. Their most well known lineup, however, and the one that recorded &quot;Rock You&quot;, was the 80s version of the band: Vollmer on vocals, accompanied by guitarists Brent &quot;The Doctor&quot; Doerner and Paul Hackman, bassist Daryl Gray, and drummer Greg &quot;Fritz&quot; Hinz. The history of the band has been marked by many lineup changes, with Vollmer being the sole constant member and only remaining member of the original lineup. Although guitarist Paul Hackman was killed in a tour bus accident in 1992, the surviving members of the 80s lineup reunited in 2009 for an album and continue to tour in 2011.\n\nHelix have toured with bands such as Kiss, Aerosmith, Rush, MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e, Alice Cooper, Whitesnake, Night Ranger, Heart, Quiet Riot, W.A.S.P., Ian Gillan, and MotÃƒÂ¶rhead among others.\n\nTheir most recent studio album is 2009's Vagabond Bones.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLong Way to Heaven is the fifth studio album by the Canadian heavy metal band Helix. This album was their third for Capitol Records, and there were bigger expectations from the band after the success of the previous Walkin' the Razor's Edge (featuring the hit &quot;Rock You&quot;). The first single was &quot;Deep Cuts the Knife&quot;, a co-write between Paul Hackman and Bob Halligan, Jr. The song received heavy airplay in the U.S., gaining &quot;double breaker&quot; status, and in Canada was added to heavy video play on MuchMusic. Q107 in Toronto had the song riding at #1 for several weeks on their &quot;Top Ten at Ten&quot;. Their first tour to kick off the album was in Sweden where they became the first Canadian rock band ever to tour that country extensively. For this they achieved their first #1 album in that country.\n\nReturning to North America, they toured with Accept and Keel, as well as headlining dates. They also played odd one-off dates with Meat Loaf and Heart. While headlining in Newfoundland, a local band called KAOS opened for Helix. This band featured Rainer and Cindy Wiechmann, who joined Helix 19 years later in 2004, on lead guitar and backup vocals respectively.\n\nThe second single released from the album was &quot;The Kids Are all Shakin'&quot;, a song inspired by a fan letter from Poland. The album went platinum in Canada and they headlined their first Canadian tour with the Headpins as the supporting act. The Long Way to Heaven album was released for the first time on CD in September, 1999.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBrian Vollmer: vocals\n\nPaul Hackman: guitar and vocals\n\nBrent &quot;The Doctor&quot; Doerner: guitar and vocals\n\nDaryl Gray: bass and vocals\n\nGreg &quot;Fritz&quot; Hinz: drums\n\n\n\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e24f08fbb368c2e621ae684b984e14f597062e7","amp;dn":"Helix+-+Long++Heaven+%5B1985%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e24f08fbb368c2e621ae684b984e14f597062e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,36,240,143,187,54,140,46,98,26,230,132,185,132,225,79,89,112,98,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
