Drugs, women, cash - all for the taking. But when The Man gives him a raw deal, he's on the run for his life. The militant Morpheus transports him to the future world of 1999, and trains him in the savage killing techniques of Kung Fu. Assuming the slasher alias Neo, he then embarks on a deadly game... of death. Trapped in a world of violence, addiction, and perversion, he is pursued by electronic monstrosities, twisted organ thieves, and the telepathic Federal Agent Smith. Now he must make a choice: kill them all... or die trying!\r\n\r\n\r\nIntention:\r\n\r\nI sought out to completely alter the movie as we know it. The presentation is now that of a mid-1980s exploitation film. The famous green tint has been removed and replaced with thick grain and print damage. The plot, character motivations, personalities, and sequence of events have been changed to tell the story in a new manner. Wherever possible, characters are made to be worse people. Everything depicted is - wherever possible - changed to be cheaper (via extensive use of behind-the-scenes footage), sleazier, darker, or simply different from the original version. The soundtrack has been almost completely replaced in favor of new music, with the emphasis on 70's synth to better suit the style and supposed time period. Continuity errors have been created where none had existed. New subplots have been added. Dialogue has been altered. I have changed everything that I possibly can change, while keeping within the context of the purpose of this project.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Sources:\r\n\r\nThe Matrix\r\nThe Matrix Revisited\r\nThe Matrix Reloaded\r\nThe Matrix Revolutions\r\nThe Animatrix\r\nJohnny Mnemonic\r\nDark City\r\nHighlander 2\r\nGrindhouse\r\nMystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie\r\nGame of Death\r\nGame of Death 2\r\nRush Hour\r\nThe Dynamite Brothers Trailer\r\nHitman (2007)\r\nThe Hit Man (1972) Trailer\r\nResident Evil (2002)\r\nThe Astro Zombies Trailer\r\nHighlander Trailer\r\nCaptain America: The First Avenger\r\nOverdrawn at the Memory Bank\r\nDrunken Fist Boxing\r\n\r\n\r\nEditing Details:\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, I tried to make the movie &quot;worse&quot;, or just plain different. With a stockpile of behind the scenes footage, and obscure Matrix-related media (such as dialogue audio files from the defenct MMORPG), I had plenty of material to work with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\n  \nhttp://i.imgur.com/72gX6Hk.jpg\r\n  \nhttp://i.imgur.com/zafAgze.jpg\r\n  \nhttp://i.imgur.com/miMQJMt.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nCover:\r\n  \nhttp://i.imgur.com/DxOuEFx.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0745ad8cb72cdc9a2c36ec44057cbd1e34eb5fc0","amp;dn":"Robots+VS+Kung+Fu%3A+The+Matrix+Grindhouse+Edition+%28FanEdit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0745ad8cb72cdc9a2c36ec44057cbd1e34eb5fc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,69,173,140,183,44,220,154,44,54,236,68,5,124,189,30,52,235,95,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
