While this family film never misses a chance to be stereotypical in its depiction of celestial beings--from white-winged angels to a red-horned devil--it is certain to warm the hearts of its intended audience. Seinfeld fans will enjoy another dose of Patrick Warburton, made famous in his role as Elaine's boyfriend, David Puddy. Here, he plays the pathetic yet endearing &quot;Steady&quot; Eddie Everett, a big league pitcher on a losing streak. As his career plummets, Eddie's wife (from whom he is separated), leaves him in charge of his estranged 13-year old ballet-loving daughter, Laurel (Brittney Irvin). An angry daughter and selfish father make for some tense beginnings, yet, as the ice melts, Laurel, who wants to restore her father's self-confidence, prays for some heavenly assistance. Her prayers are answered, sort of. Heaven's B-team of baseball angels, a bumbling group of benchwarmers led by angel Bob Bugler (David Alan Grier), are sent down to assist. In order to become a full-fledged angel, Bugler must earn his wings. He'd also love another chance at winning the pennant on Earth. As Laurel helps train this band of angelic misfits for championship baseball, a few miracles occur between an unlikely father-daughter pair. Comedic scenes abound, including an otherworldly ballet performance and a &quot;sizzling&quot; baseball finale.\n\n\nAll stand-alone divx players compatible\n\n\nENJOY &amp; PLEASE SEED FOR AS LONG AS U CAN !!!! \n\n\nALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS DON'T HESITATE TO ASK. I MIGHT HAVE WHAT YOUR LOOKING FOR.
