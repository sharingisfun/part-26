For starters, people keep dying. And then, they keep getting up again.\nSteven de Selby got promoted. This makes the increasing number of stirrers (and the disturbing rumors of a zombie god rising sometime soon) his problem. That time management seminar he keeps meaning to take would also remind him that he's got a Death Moot to plan, a Christmas party to organize, and an end-of-the-world thing to avert.\nSteven must start managing Death, before Death starts managing him, or this time the Apocalypse will be more than Regional.
