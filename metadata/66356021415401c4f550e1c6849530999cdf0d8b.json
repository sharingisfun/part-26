This book provides an assessment of modern economics that cuts\nthrough the confusion and controversy over this question. Case studies of the\ncreation of new markets, the Russian transition to capitalism, globalization, and\nmoney and finance establish that economics has been very successful where\nproblems have been well defined and where the world can be changed to fit the\ntheory, but that it has been less successful in tackling bigger problems. The book\nthen offers a historical perspective on how, since the Second World War, economists\nhave tried to make their subject scientific. It explores the evolving relationship\nbetween science and ideology and investigates the place of heterodoxy and\ndissent within the discipline. It is argued that, though there are problems with\nthe discipline, economics is needed to combat the myths that abound concerning\neconomic problems.\n\nCambridge University Press, 2010","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66356021415401c4f550e1c6849530999cdf0d8b","amp;dn":"The+Puzzle+of+Modern+Economics%3A+Science+or+Ideology%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66356021415401c4f550e1c6849530999cdf0d8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,53,96,33,65,84,1,196,245,80,225,198,132,149,48,153,156,223,13,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
