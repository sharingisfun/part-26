Hartman has seen many of his albums reissued, with rapidly rising sales, since the release of the film. This collection marks the debut of Clint Eastwood's Malpaso Records label, which Eastwood intends to focus on jazz, and it's certainly a good start, featuring songs from Hartman, Dinah Washington, Irene Kral, and Barbara Lewis, as well as two versions of &quot;Doe Eyes,&quot; an instrumental piece composed by Eastwood and arranged/conducted by longtime Eastwood collaborator Lennie Niehaus. Overall, the album is charming, low-key, and smooth, very much a record worth getting.\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n#\tTitle                         Performer\n\n01\tDoe Eyes                      Lennie Niehaus\n02\tI'll Close My Eyes            Dinah Washington\n03\tEasy Living                   Johnny Hartman\n04\tBlue Gardenia                 Dinah Washington\n05\tI See Your Face Before Me     Johnny Hartman\n06\tSoft Winds                    Dinah Washington\n07\tBaby I'm Yours                Barbara Lewis\n08\tIt's A Wonderful World        Irene Kral\n09\tIt Was Almost Like a Song     Johnny Hartman\n10\tThis Is Always                Irene Kral\n11\tFor All We Know               Johnny Hartman              \n12\tDoe Eyes (Reprise)            Lennie Niehaus","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad198f6769709119e0303db8aa4fb697d90eee21","amp;dn":"The+Bridges+Of+Madison+County+-+Soundtrack+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad198f6769709119e0303db8aa4fb697d90eee21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,25,143,103,105,112,145,25,224,48,61,184,170,79,182,151,217,14,238,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
