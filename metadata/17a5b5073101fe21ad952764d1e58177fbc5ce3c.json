A week later, the town is overrun and its communication lines cut. With all the honest men fighting the Civil War, the desperate mining investors put together a collection of outlaws, killers and thieves to re-take Brimstone ... by any means necessary. Led by 'The Viper,' a brooding gunslinger whose brutal exploits are the stuff of Western legend, the vicious posse finds the bullet-ridden town littered with dismembered corpses but its gold stores untouched. In Brimstone, the most feared men in the West have finally found the very heart of fear. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17a5b5073101fe21ad952764d1e58177fbc5ce3c","amp;dn":"Brimstone++%28Complete%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17a5b5073101fe21ad952764d1e58177fbc5ce3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,165,181,7,49,1,254,33,173,149,39,100,209,229,129,119,251,197,206,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
