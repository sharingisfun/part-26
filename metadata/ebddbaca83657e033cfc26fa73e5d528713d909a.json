They buy a Victorian mansion that once served as a haven for unwed mothers, called a birthing house. One day when Joanna is away, the previous owner visits Conrad to bequeath a vital piece of the houseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s historic heritage, a photo album that he claims Ã¢â‚¬Å“belongs to the house.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Thumbing through the old, sepia-colored photographs of midwives and fearful, unhappily pregnant girls in their starched, nineteenth-century dresses, Conrad is suddenly chilled to the bone: staring back at him with a countenance of hatred and rage is the image of his own wifeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.\n\nThus begins a story of possession, sexual obsession, and, ultimately, murder, as a centuries-old crime is reenacted in the present, turning Conrad and JoannaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s American dream into a relentless nightmare.\n\nAn extraordinary marriage of supernatural thrills and exquisite psychological suspense, The Birthing House marks the debut of a writer whose first novel is a terrifying tour de force.\n\nepub and mobi.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebddbaca83657e033cfc26fa73e5d528713d909a","amp;dn":"The+Birthing+House+By+Christopher+Ransom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebddbaca83657e033cfc26fa73e5d528713d909a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,221,186,202,131,101,126,3,60,252,38,250,115,229,213,40,113,61,144,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
