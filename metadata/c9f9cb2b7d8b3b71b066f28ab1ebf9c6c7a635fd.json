Interesting this, because it lacks the kind of \npre-metal power usually necessary for a record to achieve those levels of \ndesirability. There's some distortion, some fairly driving tracks, some slight \nsinister vibes and some good songs (&quot;To Greet The Sun,&quot; &quot;The Sacrifice,&quot; \n&quot;The Journey&quot;) but a great deal of it is also directionless middle of the road \nrock. Heavy heads will probably want to check it out, just don't expect fuzz \ndrenched, earth moving psych density mega metal, okay?  \n\nTracks\n 01. The sacrifice 6:14\n 02. See the people creeping round 4:20\n 03. And I have loved you 3:09\n 04. Freedom rider 3:19\n 05. Lost control 2:23\n 06. To greet the sun 4:05\n 07. The journey 3:55\n 08. Heat of the summer 4:01\n 09. Gypsy queen 2:53\n 10. Step out of line 4:20\n Total time: 38:34\n\nMusicians\n Adrian Hawkins: vocals\n Colin Standring: bass\n Rod Roach: guitar\n Rick Parnell: drums\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9f9cb2b7d8b3b71b066f28ab1ebf9c6c7a635fd","amp;dn":"Horse-+Horse+%281970%29+Vinyl+rip+24bit%2F44100hz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9f9cb2b7d8b3b71b066f28ab1ebf9c6c7a635fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,249,203,43,125,139,59,113,176,102,242,138,177,235,249,198,199,166,53,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
