Due to the fact that all of these artists are not currently signed to any major record labels, some song's sound quality may not be &quot;peak.&quot; The tracks were &quot;briefly&quot; remastered to &quot;somewhat&quot; normalize audio between tracks and remove as much &quot;noise&quot; as possible. However, due to the poor quality of some recordings this was not completely possible.\n\nDisc #1 Track Listing:\n\n01 - Peg Town Ent feat.

ProDesign would like to appologize for the hiatus and missing installments for November and December 2009, so we went all out for this 2010 opener and have a great line up for the January, February and March releases in advance. \n\nIf you hear something that you like here please find these and other great artists onReverbNation.com, Stereofame.com, TheSixtyOne.com, Soundclick.com, Mixposure.com, and/or various other underground music networking locations.\n\nThese are truly struggling artists that really do need our support! Buying their CD's is one great way to do so, but even stopping by their artist pages on social networks and telling them what a great job they are doing will also go a long way. They are all working really hard and doing all they can to entertain you. Most of them at their own expense. So show some love!\n\nAs always all files are completely clean and there are no RAR or ZIP files (so there are no surprises). All files are in .WAV format for ease of use and near lossless conversion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0562c83fff4e5e1b1ff8e53785debc6a3d703ac5","amp;dn":"Absolute+Best+Underground+Hip+Hop+of+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0562c83fff4e5e1b1ff8e53785debc6a3d703ac5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,98,200,63,255,78,94,27,31,248,229,55,133,222,188,106,61,112,58,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
