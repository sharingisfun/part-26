After an introduction and explanation of the basic principles of pipe flows, it covers topics ranging from cost considerations to optimal water distribution design to various types of systems to writing water distribution programs. With numerous examples and closed-form design equations, this is the definitive reference for civil and environmental engineers, water supply managers and planners, and postgraduate students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d527b74167be4b5d55564a3e3d7b6ea5bd769c56","amp;dn":"Design+of+Water+Supply+Pipe+Networks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d527b74167be4b5d55564a3e3d7b6ea5bd769c56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,39,183,65,103,190,75,93,85,86,74,62,61,123,110,165,189,118,156,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
