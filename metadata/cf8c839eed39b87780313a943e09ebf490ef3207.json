Its flagship features are listed below and the one-minute teaser video to the right is a good place to start. \n\nCompile Everything\nProcess Less, Sass, Stylus, Jade, Haml, CoffeeScript, Javascript and Compass files automatically each time you save. Easily set options for each language.\n\nLive Browser Reloads\nInstantly see changes in your browser, with animation and without hitting the refresh button or installing plugins. Great for tweaking layouts!\n\nCombine &amp; Minify\nReduce load times by mashing Javascript &amp; CoffeeScript files together and then minifying with Uglify.js. It's so easy, you'll giggle like a schoolgirl. Seriously.\n\nOptimize Images\nLosslessly reduce JPEG and PNG file sizes with one click and see the savings. One less thing to do at deployment. (More compression options coming soon!)\n\nJSHint &amp; JSLint\nMakes debugging scripts fun and easy. Instantly find that one hanging comma that kills IE, or enforce coding styles and best practices across teams.\n\nTeam Collaboration\nSync project settings across teams and computers in an open JSON format. Keep everyone on the same page or easily jumpstart new sites.\n\nEasy Frameworks\nKeep just one copy of a file on your drive and easily use it across many projects without worrying about file paths. No more copying files into every new site.\n\nIt Just Works\nThere's nothing to install or configure. No mucking around the command line. Just run the app and start working. It's that easy. \n\nREQS: Mac OS 10.7+\n\nVersion 1.2.3 (6554)\n1 August 2012\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Resolved several issues with Mountain Lion compatibility.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ FIXED: an issue that produced crashes when checking a script with JSLint on 10.8. (This one wasn't my fault; there was an error in the JSLint library itself that crashed the new JavascriptCore engine in 10.8. Even Doug Crockford screws up, apparently.)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ FIXED: @import paths that begin with a period to indicate the current directory will now link correctly in the app.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Killed an edge-case memory leak.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The file-watching engine (VDKQueue) is now *even* faster. You'd pretty much need an atomic clock to track it, though.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The status bar icon is now retina-fied. Mainly because some guy requested it on Twitter. His face will soon be introduced to a Retina Macbook Pro traveling at high velocity.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Node.js --&gt; updated to 0.8.2 (brings full support for UTF-16)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Less.js --&gt; still at version 1.3.0, but updated to a newer commit that brings support for keyframe animations in WebKit and ratios in media queries.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Uglify.js --&gt; updated to 1.3.3\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Stylus --&gt; updated to 0.28.2\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ JSLint --&gt; updated to the 27 July 2012 build.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ JSHint --&gt; updated to the 30 July 2012 build. (New &quot;camelcase&quot; and &quot;worker&quot; options)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sass --&gt; updated to 3.1.20. (Which is like 3.2, if you squint.)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Jade --&gt; updated to 0.27.0. (Because TJ hates numbers larger than 1.)\n\nCredits to Special [K]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf8c839eed39b87780313a943e09ebf490ef3207","amp;dn":"CodeKit+1.2.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf8c839eed39b87780313a943e09ebf490ef3207","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,140,131,158,237,57,184,119,128,49,58,148,62,9,235,244,144,239,50,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
