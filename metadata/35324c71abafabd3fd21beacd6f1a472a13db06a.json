It is erroneously labeled as a Philadelphia performance in 1978, but in fact it was the Mother's Day (5/13/79) show from the Tower Theatre in Upper Darby, Pa. The entire show was broadcast over the Philadelphia radio station WIOQ (102 FM). The sound quality is very good to excellent, and the performance is fair to good.
