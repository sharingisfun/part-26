Never purposely fashionable, The Saints were Garage rockers caught up in the Punk scene, but their raw dirty sound fit perfectly into the Punk aesthetic.. This release is coinciding with a monumental occasion in Aussie musical history: The three surviving members of The Saints (Chris Bailey, Ed Kuepper and Ivor Hay) are reuniting for a one-off historical performance in Brisbane in July of 2007. 18 tracks.
