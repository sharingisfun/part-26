One In A Million\n\n\nComprised of a previously released EP and 4 new acoustic tracks, Lies succeeded in recasting GN'R into a band with more depth than any other L.A. group. The first half, the live tracks (actually studio with overdubbed crowd noises) is a nice snapshot of the band's embryonic period. The 4 acoustic songs are the heart of the record; the lovely, generous Patience sets a gentle mood, but the rest is unremittingly dark. An exorcism of raw emotion.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 29\nArtist: Guns N' Roses\nAlbum: G N' R Lies \nYear: 1988\nGenre: Hard Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d899ac89da86db70bb2c00fb984c7c2e574ab45","amp;dn":"Guns+N%5C%27+Roses+-+Lies+%5BFLAC-1988%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d899ac89da86db70bb2c00fb984c7c2e574ab45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,137,154,200,157,168,109,183,11,178,192,15,185,132,199,194,229,116,171,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
