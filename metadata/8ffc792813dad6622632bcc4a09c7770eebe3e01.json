She offers achingly acute portraits of the people she met along the wayÃ¢â‚¬â€and issues a heartfelt call for more effective action to aid this vast, deprived population. Determined to supply the homeless with the basic necessities to keep them alive, she ends up giving them something far more powerful: a voice.\n\nBy turns candid and inspirational, Danielle SteelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s A Gift of Hope is a true act of advocacy and love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ffc792813dad6622632bcc4a09c7770eebe3e01","amp;dn":"A+Gift+of+Hope+by+Danielle+Steel+%282012%29+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ffc792813dad6622632bcc4a09c7770eebe3e01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,252,121,40,19,218,214,98,38,50,188,196,160,156,119,112,238,190,62,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
