Both were child prodigies who died, within two months of each other, at an early age, of tuberculosis, in a foreign country (Arriaga, a Spaniard, in France at the age of 19, Vorisek, a Bohemian, in Austria at 34). And each wrote his only symphony around 1823 â€“ in the key of D.\r\nBoth composers show themselves fond of Schubertian modulations and key shifts, but whereas Arriaga's chief influences seem to be Mozart (in the symphony's elegant Andante ) and Rossini (in the sparkling Allegro of his Overture and the orchestral crescendo towards its end), Vorisek, who was brought up on Mozart and was in fact taught philosophy by Mozart's first biographer, plainly was already entering Beethoven territory, with striding bass figures in the first movement and, particularly, with the fiery scherzo (whose Trio features a solo horn). Arriaga calls his third movement a Minuet, but this too is in fact a scherzo, unusually constructed in one span rather than in binary form: the Trio here is devoted to a flute solo. The outer movements of this work are agitated, in the Sturm und Drang tradition, and Mackerras makes the most of the initial Allegro vivace 's abrupt dynamic contrasts â€“ more vividly dramatic than Savall. He secures considerable finesse in the SCO's performances â€“ the lovingly phrased introduction to Arriaga's Overture and the ingratiating start of the Vorisek are seductive â€“ but it is the excitable energy of the latter that brings forth the most spectacular playing: the tremendous vigour of its finale makes this a demonstration track.
