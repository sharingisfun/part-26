In the first years the band was defining itself as to the directions it must follow and several line up changes took place until the 2001 demo (''Lilith'') when new members joined the band (Sahmor- Voices, Bill- Bass) and recorded the 2002 promo ( ''The moor reflected heretic innocence'') where several guest musicians participated such as Lethe (Septic Flesh), Kinthia (Astarte) and choir artists that led to a record deal with Ebony Tears record label from Netherlands. However, due to quite a few reasons such as studies and army services of members, left the band behind for a while since the album's recording in 2003 ('' A quatrain for the damned''). At the moment Shadows Dance are focusing on new tracks to complete a new promo regarding a record deal. 1999 Shadows Dance (demo) 2000 Last Kiss (demo) 2001- Lilith (demo) 2002- The moor reflected heretic innocence (promo) 2003- A Quatrain for the Damned album (Ebony Tears) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51ee3139230f0e89a9898ff8e320d8129c4a7321","amp;dn":"Shadows+Dance+-+A+Quatrain+For+The+Damned","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51ee3139230f0e89a9898ff8e320d8129c4a7321","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,238,49,57,35,15,14,137,169,137,143,248,227,32,216,18,156,74,115,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
