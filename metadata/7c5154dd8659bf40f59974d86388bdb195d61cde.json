After two years with the Steve Miller Band, Scaggs once again set out on his own, recording at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Sheffield, Alabama. The other musicians on the album include Duane Allman, Eddie Hinton, Jimmy Johnson, Barry Beckett, David Hood, Roger Hawkins and Al Lester. It was produced by Rolling Stone founder and editor Jann Wenner, Scaggs, and Marlin Greene.\n\nThe album sold slowly despite positive reviews. Originally mixed by Stax Records' engineer Terry Manning, it remained in the catalog for a number of years and was deleted around 1974 or 1975.\n\nIn 1977 the album was remixed in Los Angeles by Tom Perry and was released by Atlantic in 1978 to spotlight Duane Allman's guitar playing, with the same cover art. As well as the guitar, the remix brings several things forward in the mix such as horns, background voices and keyboards; there is also an odd 30 second volume drop at the end of &quot;Finding Her&quot;. This remix was the only complete version of the album available on CD until the Audio Fidelity remastered release of December 2013, which restored the original master mix in its entirety. \n\nIn 2008, the album was reissued by Friday Music on a 180 gram vinyl LP using the original mix for the first time since the album was originally released. \n\nIn a 2012 updated list, the album listed at #496 on the Rolling Stone's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;I'm Easy&quot; (Scaggs, Barry Beckett) - 3:05\n    &quot;I'll Be Long Gone&quot; - 4:13\n    &quot;Another Day (Another Letter)&quot; - 2:53\n    &quot;Now You're Gone&quot; - 3:47\n    &quot;Finding Her&quot; - 3:56\n    &quot;Look What I Got&quot; (Charles Chalmers, Donna Rhodes) - 4:10\n    &quot;Waiting for a Train&quot; (Jimmie Rodgers) - 2:40\n    &quot;Loan Me a Dime&quot; (Fenton Robinson) - 12:30\n    &quot;Sweet Release (aka Desolation Avenue)&quot; (Scaggs, Beckett) - 6:13\n\n-----------------------\n\n    Boz Scaggs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, vocals\n    Tracy Nelson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ background vocals\n    Jeanie Greene Ã¢â‚¬â€œ background vocals\n    Duane Allman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, dobro, slide guitar\n    Joe Arnold Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tenor saxophone\n    Barry Beckett Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards\n    Ben Cauley Ã¢â‚¬â€œ trumpet\n    Charles Chalmers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tenor saxophone\n    Joyce Dunn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ background vocals\n    Roger Hawkins Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n    Eddie Hinton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, slide guitar, dobro\n    Mary Holliday Ã¢â‚¬â€œ background vocals\n    David Hood Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n    Jimmy Johnson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n    Al Lester Ã¢â‚¬â€œ fiddle, violin\n    Gene &quot;Bowlegs&quot; Miller Ã¢â‚¬â€œ trombone, trumpet\n    James Mitchell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ baritone saxophone\n    Floyd Newman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ baritone saxophone\n    Terry Manning Ã¢â‚¬â€œ engineer\n    Irma Routen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ background vocals\n    Donna Jean Godchaux nÃƒÂ©e, Thatcher Ã¢â‚¬â€œ background vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c5154dd8659bf40f59974d86388bdb195d61cde","amp;dn":"Boz+Scaggs+-+Boz+Scaggs+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c5154dd8659bf40f59974d86388bdb195d61cde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,81,84,221,134,89,191,64,245,153,116,216,99,136,189,177,149,214,28,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
