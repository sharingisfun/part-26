France have a proud history in the tournament but have not lifted the trophy since 2010, something new head coach Guy Noves will be aiming to rectify. Following a disappointing performance at the World Cup and the retirement of players such as captain Thierry Dusautoir, a new-look team takes to the field for Les Bleus. Italy, meanwhile, hope to catch their hosts cold and land a repeat of the 23-18 opening game win over France in Rome in 2013. Commentary is by Eddie Butler, Jonathan Davies and Carlo Del Fava.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 6744Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 50i/MBAFF\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 384Kbps CBR 48KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 6\r\nRun-Time: 170 mins\r\nPart Size: 8.95 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f969b0a93b007155a4f93c00f850f1315f60d460","amp;dn":"Six.Nations.Rugby.2016.02.06.France.v.Italy.1080i.h264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f969b0a93b007155a4f93c00f850f1315f60d460","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,105,176,169,59,0,113,85,164,249,60,0,248,80,241,49,95,96,212,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
