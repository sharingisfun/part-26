If your amp is &quot;turned up to 11&quot;\n\nor if you're using dynamic compression, you can get a tone by simply fingering\n\nthe fretboard.  If you do this with both hands your name might be Stanley Jordan.\n\n\n\n&quot;An instant classic, and one of the definitive moments of modern jazz guitar.&quot;\n\n                               Daniel Gioffre  ALLMUSIC\n\n\n\n\navailable elsewhere in LOSSY\n\n                                                     ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:876571bacd875f052876a9bc28745818db3055da","amp;dn":"Stanley+Jordan%2C+MAGIC+TOUCH%2C+%281985%29+DDD++Blue+Note","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"876571bacd875f052876a9bc28745818db3055da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,101,113,186,205,135,95,5,40,118,169,188,40,116,88,24,219,48,85,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
