Sound level adjusted. Some hiss reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an upload which I will do for another old friend of mine (no.66). He has a collection of recordings partly which he taped himself and most of them originate from the 80's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first recording ever made by no.66 and then such a concert (and it is the complete concert)! There are already 2 different sources circulating from this concert and this is the 3rd one. Unfortunately there were some problems mostly during the first tracks concerning sound level and some distortions resulting from too high level. It is not clear where these distortions are resulting from as there seemed to be some major problems with the PA at the venue. Also it seems that no.66 changed his position or at least the position of the mike during the concert several times. But all in all a very intense recording which captures the enigma of the band and especially Ian Curtis impressingly. I wish I could have been there. But at least we have this recording here to get a glimpse of the historic greatness of the band.\r\n\r\nAttched are some photos and the flyer of the gig.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSetlist (tape length 65:50 min.) \r\n\r\n01 Atmosphere\r\n02 Love will Tear Us Apart\r\n03 These Days\r\n04 Insight\r\n05 Twenty Four Hours\r\n06 A Means to an End\r\n07 She's Lost Control\r\n08 Sound of Music\r\n09 Glass\r\n10 Day of the Lords\r\n11 Shadowplay\r\n12 Interzone\r\n13 Disorder\r\n14 Transmission\r\n15 encore call\r\n16 Atrocity Exhibition \r\n\r\nthe band:\r\n\r\nIan Curtis - vocals , guitar\r\nBernard Sumner - guitar, keyboards\r\nPeter Hook - bass, vocals\r\nStephen Morris - drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7d2368a5d7139fa828eae3de8f99c54cf463fc5","amp;dn":"Joy+Division+-+Live+-+1980+-+Cologne%2C+Germany","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7d2368a5d7139fa828eae3de8f99c54cf463fc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,210,54,138,93,113,57,250,130,142,174,61,232,249,156,84,207,70,63,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
