Euterpe Gratitude Piece (Bonus Track)\n\nDaevid Allen's flights of fancy and cheerful hippie proselytizing have given birth to projects as diverse as the progressive rock of Gong as well as naturalistic solo works such as Good Morning. This record was recorded in 1976, six years after Allen's last solo outing, Banana Moon. It differs markedly from that record, as well as his group work with Gong. Good Morning is more acoustic, with no drums, and was recorded on a four-track tape machine at Allen's Majorcan home, &quot;Bananamoon Observatory.&quot; As with Gong, Allen plays his cosmic-effected &quot;glissando&quot; guitar, and he calls on girlfriend Gilli Smyth for her signature &quot;space whisper.&quot; Additionally, he employs an unknown Spanish group called Euterpe. The songs here merge together well and have a childlike wonder, punctuated by Allen's singsong delivery and some peaceful synth. Side one is the quiet, poetic side, whereas side two comes closest to Gong, with the moody 11-minute &quot;Wise Man in Your Heart.&quot; Where previously Allen leaned on the compositional skills of Smyth, Christian Tritsch, and others, all of the songs on this record were written by Allen. The word that best describes his songwriting would be relaxed. Allen doesn't strive for profundity, and in so doing creates a work filled with humility and charm.
