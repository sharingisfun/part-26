This mishmash of singles, B-sides, and stray tracks from past British releases did have some fine moments, particularly the singles &quot;Call Me Lightning&quot; and the Bo Diddley-influenced &quot;Magic Bus,&quot; which became one of their most popular concert numbers. Other highlights are the fine 1966 pop-art tune &quot;Disguises&quot; and John Entwistle&amp;#039;s hysterical &quot;Doctor, Doctor,&quot; but these (and a few of the other cuts) are now available as bonus tracks on the Quick One and Who Sell Out reissues. Completists should know that one song, Entwistle&amp;#039;s typically black-humored &quot;Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde,&quot; is unavailable on any other U.S. release, so it&amp;#039;s not time to throw away your copy of Magic Bus just yet.\n\nRichie Unterberger, AMG\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEAC Log, Cue &amp; Complete Artwork Included.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\nP.S.: After you&amp;#039;ve done, please someone upload this to Demonoid.
