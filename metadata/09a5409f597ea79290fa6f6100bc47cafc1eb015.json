This idea has been developed at different occasions since that time. The book is made of different kinds of contributions:\n -ethnograhic or quasi-ethnographic studies on the use of mathematics at the\n workplace (Zevenbergen; Noss, Hoyles and Pozzi);\n -analytical descriptions of the mathematical activities involved in different professions (Bessot; Eberhard; Mercier); presentations and explanations concerning the kind of mathematics that is taught in vocational schools (Straesser; Wedege; Hahn), or the kind of mathematics that is needed and should be taught better (Ridgway ; Wake and Williams; Gillespie).\n Finally some chapters deal with specific didactical problems like slow learners (Van der Zwaart), technological resources, or symbolic tools (Evans). Severa contributions deal with the problem of articulating mathematics taught in schools and mathematics used in professional practices. Evans proposes to reformulate the problem of transfer by relating with one another different practices and different kinds of signifiers. It is also a good point.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09a5409f597ea79290fa6f6100bc47cafc1eb015","amp;dn":"Education+for+Mathematics+in+the+Workplace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09a5409f597ea79290fa6f6100bc47cafc1eb015","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,165,64,159,89,126,167,146,144,250,111,97,0,188,71,202,252,30,176,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
