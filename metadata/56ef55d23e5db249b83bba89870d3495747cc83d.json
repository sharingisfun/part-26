Matrices represent linear transformations\nfrom a finite set of numbers to another finite set of\nnumbers.Since many important problems are linear, and since\ndigital computers with finite memory manipulate only finite\nsets of numbers, the solution of linear problems by digital\ncomputers usually involves matrices. Developed from the\nauthor's course on matrix theory at the California Institute\nof Technology, the book begins with a concise presentation\nof the theory of determinants, continues with a discussion\nof classical linear algebra, and an optional chapter on the\nuse of matrices to solve systems of linear triangularizations\nof Hermitian and nonHermitian matrices, as well as a chapter\npresenting a proof of the difficult and important matrix\ntheory of Jordan. The book concludes with discussions of\nvariational principles and perturbation theory of matrices,\nmatrix numerical analysis, and an introduction to the\nsubject of linear computations.\n\nMatrix Theory\nBy: Joel N.
