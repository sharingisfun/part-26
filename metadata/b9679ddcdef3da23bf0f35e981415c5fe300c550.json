It is a standalone narrative, with its own beginning and ending. \n\n*Note: This is not To the Moon 2, and is meant to be a much lighter, whimsical short. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nA word of caution from the devs: This is a rather polarizing game, particularly for fans of To the Moon. As a guarantee with all games from Freebird, there is a 100% personal (confidential) refund policy with no questions asked; if it just isn't your cup of tea. Details here. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKey Features\nA story-driven experience with no dialogues \nA mix between adventure game elements and classic RPG aesthetics \nAn original soundtrack tailored to the narrative \nAn espresso execution with no time drains","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9679ddcdef3da23bf0f35e981415c5fe300c550","amp;dn":"A+Bird+Story+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9679ddcdef3da23bf0f35e981415c5fe300c550","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,103,157,220,222,243,218,35,191,15,53,233,129,65,92,95,227,0,197,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
