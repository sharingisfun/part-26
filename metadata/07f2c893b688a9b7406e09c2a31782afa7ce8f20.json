However, just as world peace seemed within the grasp of man, a new species of ghostly parasitic creatures appeared and began attacking humans. Dubbed &quot;pulses&quot;, the world fought back by forming a strike team of commandos called Phobia. These heroes combat the threat of the pulses and try to safeguard the planet from future attacks.\n\nWritten by Andrew Dabb and illustrated by Kano Kang and Zack Suh.
