Instead of a cover song, lead singer Shane MacGowan and banjo player Jem Finer decided to write one themselves. The first attempts to record this were as a duet with MacGowan and Pogues bass player Cait O&amp;#039;Riordan. They didn&amp;#039;t have the song ready for a Christmas single, so they recorded it for their third album, If I Should Fall From Grace With God, which was produced by Steve Lillywhite. Lillywhite took tapes home and had his wife, Kirsty MacColl record a scratch vocal, but her voice was so good that they decided to keep it.\n\n\nFairytale Of New York lyrics:\n\nIt was christmas eve babe\nIn the drunk tank\nAn old man said to me, wont see another one\nAnd then he sang a song\nThe rare old mountain dew\nI turned my face away\nAnd dreamed about you\n\nGot on a lucky one\nCame in eighteen to one\nIve got a feeling\nThis years for me and you\nSo happy christmas\nI love you baby\nI can see a better time\nWhen all our dreams come true\n\nTheyve got cars big as bars\nTheyve got rivers of gold\nBut the wind goes right through you\nIts no place for the old\nWhen you first took my hand\nOn a cold christmas eve\nYou promised me\nBroadway was waiting for me\n\nYou were handsome\nYou were pretty\nQueen of new york city\nWhen the band finished playing\nThey howled out for more\nSinatra was swinging,\nAll the drunks they were singing\nWe kissed on a corner\nThen danced through the night\n\nThe boys of the nypd choir\nWere singing galway bay\nAnd the bells were ringing out\nFor christmas day\n\nYoure a bum\nYoure a punk\nYoure an old slut on junk\nLying there almost dead on a drip in that bed\nYou scumbag, you maggot\nYou cheap lousy faggot\nHappy christmas your arse\nI pray God its our last\n\nI could have been someone\nWell so could anyone\nYou took my dreams from me\nWhen I first found you\nI kept them with me babe\nI put them with my own\nCant make it all alone\nIve built my dreams around you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c63277af371a8f87387cb330b6366c45c01ced69","amp;dn":"The+Pogues+%26+Kirsty+McColl+-+Fairytale+Of+New+York","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c63277af371a8f87387cb330b6366c45c01ced69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,50,119,175,55,26,143,135,56,124,179,48,182,54,108,69,192,28,237,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
