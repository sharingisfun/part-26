You can view your iPhone's photos directly in Finder or Windows Explorer like you would from any other digital camera. You're also able to get file system access to data contained within the apps or other directories on your device.\r\n\r\nWant to back up or move your games' high scores from one device to another? How about saving files directly to or from your favorite file manager such as iExplorer's iOS App iExplorer Mobile? iExplorer can do all of that and more.\r\n\r\nExport Voicemails, Address Book Contacts, Calendar Events, Reminders, Notes &amp; More...\r\nWe've crafted seven magnificent utilities into iExplorer that allow you to browse, preview, save, and export the most important information in the databases of your iPhone or iPad.\r\n\r\nView your appointments, calendar events, and your call history. Listen to your iPhone's voicemail messages and export them to a folder on your computer. Everything is always just a couple of clicks away. Be in charge of your content.\r\n\r\nAccess Photos, Files &amp; Everything Else\r\nWith iExplorer, you can access more files and folders without modifying (jailbreaking) your device than ever before. Need to access photos on your iPhone or iPod? Can do. Want to access the files and folders of your device's apps? Done. How about browsing through your iTunes backups? Check. What about the media folders containing your iTunes purchases? We've got that too. What about files in apps that are synced to iCloud? Yes, even that.*\r\n\r\niExplorer also works great if your iPhone is Jailbroken. With AFC2 access, the app can read and write to the iOS device's real root (For advanced users only!).\r\n*iCloud access is for Mac only.\r\n\r\nOfficial Website: https://www.macroplant.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e89e8b026d7f1600034773f638321f5f722f3553","amp;dn":"Macroplant+iExplorer+v3.9.8.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e89e8b026d7f1600034773f638321f5f722f3553","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,158,139,2,109,127,22,0,3,71,115,246,56,50,31,95,114,47,53,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
