Though Lawson was primarily a landscape painter, he also painted a small number of realistic urban scenes. His painting style is heavily influenced by the art of John Henry Twachtman, J. Alden Weir, and Alfred Sisley. Though considered an American Impressionist, Lawson falls stylistically between Impressionism and realism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b53251aa6bb77559c731d2b0a99d0902bf8a801d","amp;dn":"Ernest+Lawson+%281873+%26ndash%3B+1939%29+%28Art+Paintings%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b53251aa6bb77559c731d2b0a99d0902bf8a801d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,50,81,170,107,183,117,89,199,49,210,176,169,157,9,2,191,138,128,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
