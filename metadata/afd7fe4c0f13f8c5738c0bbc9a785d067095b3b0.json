Penniless, he returns to his hometown in Miami and tries to get his life in order.\n\nMichael freelances his skills to earn money in an effort to find out who burned him and why. He is assisted by his friends Fiona, an ex-IRA operative and Sam, a semi-retired spy.\n\n    &quot;My name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until (a phone rings telling him he's been burned), when you're burned, you've got nothing ? no cash, no credit, no job history. You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in. You do whatever work comes your way. You rely on anyone who's still talking to you. A trigger happy ex-girlfriend, a old friend who's informing on you to the FBI. Family too, If your desperate. Bottom line, until you figure out who burned you. Your not going any where.&quot;\n\n\nContents of download:  Burn.Notice.S01.DVDRip.x264.AC3-COMPLETE\n\n burn.notice.101.x264.6ch-ibs.mkv (871.72 megabyte)\n burn.notice.102.x264.6ch-ibs.mkv (555.69 megabyte)\n burn.notice.103.x264.6ch-ibs.mkv (550.96 megabyte)\n burn.notice.104.x264.6ch-ibs.mkv (557.68 megabyte)\n burn.notice.105.x264.6ch-ibs.mkv (564.84 megabyte)\n burn.notice.106.x264.6ch-ibs.mkv (551.52 megabyte)\n burn.notice.107.x264.6ch-ibs.mkv (560.31 megabyte)\n burn.notice.108.x264.6ch-ibs.mkv (556.32 megabyte)\n burn.notice.109.x264.6ch-ibs.mkv (550.32 megabyte)\n burn.notice.110.x264.6ch-ibs.mkv (557.36 megabyte)\n burn.notice.111-12.x264.6ch-ibs.mkv (1.07 gigabyte)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afd7fe4c0f13f8c5738c0bbc9a785d067095b3b0","amp;dn":"Burn+Notice+S01+DVDRip+x264+704x400+AC3+5.1ch-COMPLETE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afd7fe4c0f13f8c5738c0bbc9a785d067095b3b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,215,254,76,15,19,248,197,115,140,11,188,154,120,93,6,112,149,179,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
