Throughout the last\ncentury, the scientific community progressed tremendously in realizing that our\nenvironment fluctuates more often than not. Unfortunately, theories advanced to\nexplain cyclic behavior generally failed to consistently match the historical record\nleft by nature. The Unified Cycle Theory fills that void.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58614160b7a0a6cbbd3509220cbe74b7db82677e","amp;dn":"Stephen+Puetz+-+The+Unified+Cycle+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58614160b7a0a6cbbd3509220cbe74b7db82677e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,97,65,96,183,160,166,203,189,53,9,34,12,190,116,183,219,130,103,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
