When she awakes, she finds that the planet from Alien has been colonized but all contact has been lost. This time, the rescue team has impressive firepower but will it be enough?\n\nEncoders notes: \nThis file is optimized for playback on ps3, xbox 360 and apple tv. The size is kept at under 4 gig for storage on ps3 external fat 32 hdd.\n\nAgain, another rough source. The film is very noisy. \nI encoded segments of the film several times to get the right settings for the full movie. The end result is better looking than the origional dvd. All the extra time and work payed off. \n\nAditional notes: This is the fully extended edition of James Camerons classic. It has loads more scenes than the directors cut ( introduces the full colony ). In James Camerons own words &quot; This is the story people were meant to see&quot;.\n\nThis movie is the special feature from the third disk of the 9 disk quadrilogy box set. Each movie disk contains the theatrical version and a special version.\n\nEnjoy this movie. \n\n-==D-L33T3==-\n\nPilot Release Group\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e849bf20e9770f4dc686d172d978cb001dcf2ee","amp;dn":"Aliens%5B1986%5DSpecial+Edition%5BExtended%5D+-+H264+-+D-L33T3+%5BPilot+RG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e849bf20e9770f4dc686d172d978cb001dcf2ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,132,155,242,14,151,112,244,220,104,109,23,45,151,140,176,1,220,242,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
