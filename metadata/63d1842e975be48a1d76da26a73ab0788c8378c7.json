Chemical thermodynamics and kinetics are applied to soil systems in order to provide an understanding of phenomena ranging from complexation reactions to colloidal flocculation. The book addresses the limitations of these applications and proposes that the quantitative description of soils is not complete without adequate characterization of the rates of the chemical reactions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63d1842e975be48a1d76da26a73ab0788c8378c7","amp;dn":"Chemical+Equilibria+and+Kinetics+in+Soils","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63d1842e975be48a1d76da26a73ab0788c8378c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,209,132,46,151,91,228,138,29,118,218,38,167,58,176,120,140,131,120,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
