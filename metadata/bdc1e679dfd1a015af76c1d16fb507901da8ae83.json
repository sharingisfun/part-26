Her family moved to Lindenhurst, New York on Long Island, when she was 3 years old. &quot;I have wonderful childhood memories of picking berries in the 'woods' by our house, driving to the 'docks' on the South Bay to get freshly harvested clams&quot;, she recounted once.\n\nPatti (as she was known) became interested in theater and began voice lessons, singing at Daniel Street Elementary School her first solo, a song called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt Must Be Spring,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ at age eight. She said, &quot;As a kid, I sang at any choir, any denomination, anywhere I could.&quot; At Lindenhurst Senior High School (1967ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“71), Benatar participated in musical theater, playing Queen Guinevere in the school production of Camelot, marching in the homecoming parade, singing at the annual Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony, and performing a solo of &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; on a holiday recording of the Lindenhurst High School Choir her senior year.\n\nBenatar was cut off from the rock scene in nearby Manhattan though because her parents were &quot;ridiculously strict - I was allowed to go to symphonies, opera and theater but I couldn't go to clubs&quot;. Her musical training was strictly classical and theatrical. She said, &quot;I was singing Puccini and West Side Story but I spent every afternoon after school with my little transistor radio listening to the Rolling Stones...&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdc1e679dfd1a015af76c1d16fb507901da8ae83","amp;dn":"Pat+Benatar+-+Precious+Time+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdc1e679dfd1a015af76c1d16fb507901da8ae83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,193,230,121,223,209,160,21,175,118,193,209,111,181,7,144,29,168,174,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
