Red Hill features trumpeter\nWadada Leo Smith, pianist Jamie Saft, bassist Joe Morris, and drummer BalÃƒÂ¡zs\nPÃƒÂ¡ndi in a completely improvised setting. No one brought compositions -- or any\npreconceived ideas -- to the studio; everything unfolded on the spot. Saft,\nMorris, and PÃƒÂ¡ndi have all worked together on RareNoise before in various\ncombinations -- most recently as three-fourths of Slobber Pup on 2013's\nexcellent Black Aces. Though Smith is the outlier, he is not the group's\nleader. What is at work on Red Hill is the voice of a creative and surprisingly\nunified anarchy. There is plenty of firepower, but this is no skronk\nsession. PÃƒÂ¡ndi's drumming is all fluid motion. He employs the kit's tools\nsimultaneously, providing roiling force and rounded fragmentary pulses that are\nmelodic in nature; his playing is always busy yet never cluttered and recalls\nRashied Ali in his musicality. Morris, whether demonstrating fleet pizzicato\nruns, arco swirls, or rapidly strummed chords, twins his dynamic and intricate\nharmonic strengths as a front-line player. Smith's trademark multiphonics\nblast, croon, sing, or whisper here; his lyric sensibility is used in service\nto the process of this collective mutual discovery. Saft, with his vast\nharmonic palette and deep rhythmic sensibility, allows his many musical\ninterests -- from classical and jazz to Caribbean, Jewish, and African musics\n-- to inform his template of colors, timbres, and tones. He is often the\ngroup's compass, hinting at a way forward in a spacious maelstrom of sounds and\ntextures. An example is three quarters of the way through &quot;Janus Point.&quot; Smith\ndrops out momentarily as Morris' arco exchanges furiously in interplay with\nPÃƒÂ¡ndi. Saft's response is at first to drop a continuous series of single notes\nbefore slipping lower-register chordal voicings inside that labyrinth. He\ncreates a reentry point for Smith -- this time with a mute -- to carve and\nshape a different tonal direction before engaging with the pianist in a canny,\nkinetic, and emotive new section as bass and drums fill and frame the\nedges. The circular piano and drumming in &quot;Tragic Wisdom&quot; provide Morris an\nopportunity to articulate a gorgeous harmonic pulse as Smith and Saft work from\ndifferent pointillistic ends of the spectrum. PÃƒÂ¡ndi provides propulsion and\naccented detail across the center. None of these five selections is under seven\nand a half minutes, so the music is allowed to develop and unfold\nunhurriedly. There are no duels, or teams engaging in competitive musical\nathletics. These four highly individual voices all contribute to a vast\nconversation that contains many multiple utterances inside what is revealed as\na bracing, new, but common language. Red Hill is avant-garde jazz at its best;\non the spot, its players continually reinvent themselves and the music.\n\n--\n\nBy Ed Pettersen and Stefan Wood &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2014/12/wadada-leo-smith-joe-morris-jamie-saft.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2014/12/wadada-leo-smith-joe-morris-jamie-saft.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Greg Buium &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD49/PoD49MoreMoments5.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD49/PoD49MoreMoments5.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy John Ephland &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/red-hill-red-hill-rarenoiserecords-review-by-john-ephland.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/red-hill-red-hill-rarenoiserecords-review-by-john-ephland.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDa Elfio Nicolosi (it) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.traccedijazz.it/index.php/nuove-uscite/25-nuove-uscite-straniere/648-wadada-leo-smith-jamie-saft-joe-morris-balazs-pandi-red-hill&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.traccedijazz.it/index.php/nuove-uscite/25-nuove-uscite-straniere/648-wadada-leo-smith-jamie-saft-joe-morris-balazs-pandi-red-hill&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPor Ãƒï¿½lex SÃƒÂ¡nchez (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.elestadomental.com/revistas/num6/paywall/discos&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.elestadomental.com/revistas/num6/paywall/discos&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:539a1f949c0ef45401319bee90bbf888676a7d1b","amp;dn":"Smith%2C+Saft%2C+Morris%2C+Pandi+-+Red+Hill+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"539a1f949c0ef45401319bee90bbf888676a7d1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,154,31,148,156,14,244,84,1,49,155,238,144,187,248,136,103,106,125,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
