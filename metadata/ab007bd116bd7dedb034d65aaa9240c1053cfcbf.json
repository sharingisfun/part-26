Those who are familiar with the Afro-Cuban Allstars have an even BETTER idea of what to expect. Felix Baloy teamed up with the Afro-Cuban Allstars on their releases and laid down some brilliant vocals. Here, he takes on a more &quot;solo&quot; effort. Really though, it's the Afro-Cuban Allstars (and the incredible Juan De Marcos Gonzalez) backing him up. Those who know, Afro-Cuban Allstars are a more up-tempo, jazzier take on what the BVSC is doing. The songs are much more dancier, salsa oriented. The mellow stuff is best found on the BVSC release, or any of the solo efforts by members of the BVSC (i.e., Ibrahim Ferrer, Compay Segundo, Ruben Gonzalez, Omara Portuondo, etc.). This stuff is for dancing and getting the fiesta started. If you aren't familiar with the BVSC or Afro-Cuban Allstars, but ARE familiar with anything in the &quot;Cubanismo&quot; series, you can compare this release to that kind of stuff. However, in my humble opinion, this (and every other BVSC or Afro-Cuban Allstars release) is MUCH, MUCH better than the Cubanismo series. And, I will admit, that is saying a great deal because the Cubanismo series isn't bad at all. In short, get this, get this, get this! It's much harder to come by than any of the other releases I mentioned, but it is sooooooo very worth having. A must in your collection!&quot;\n\n&quot;I cannot say enough in praise of Juan de Marcos GonzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lez, for it was HE who brought together the Buena Vista Social Club project and made it happen. GonzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lez has a unique talent for bringing together the greatest musicians and singers available, then orchestrating the most outstanding Cuban music so as to present it in a way that is sure to delight music lovers everywhere. Fans of Afro Cuban music will find none better. His Afro Cuban All Stars are a somewhat fluid ensemble that has featured such Cuban greats as Teresa Garcia Caturla, Ibrahim Ferrer, RubÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©n GonzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lez, Amadito Valdez, &quot;Cachaito&quot; LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³pez, Barbarito Torres, and &quot;Guajiro&quot; Mirabal, among others.&quot;\n\n&quot;This was my second Cuban album after Buena Vista Social Club. However these tracks are far more dance-able than BVSC: everything from Cha Cha Cha to Meringue and Salsa.\nFor those who know the music of Felix Baloy - this is another &quot;feel-good&quot; album - brilliant for getting you in the mood for an evening of going out, or for getting you up in the morning.&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
