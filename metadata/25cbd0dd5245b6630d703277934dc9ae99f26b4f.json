This is my personal favourite period instrument performance of these works. It makes an interesting contrast to Hogwood's 1980s recording of the Brandenburgs with this same orchestra.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25cbd0dd5245b6630d703277934dc9ae99f26b4f","amp;dn":"Bach%2C+JS+-+Brandenburg+Concertos+-+Egarr%2C+AAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25cbd0dd5245b6630d703277934dc9ae99f26b4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,203,208,221,82,69,182,99,13,112,50,119,147,77,201,174,153,242,107,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
