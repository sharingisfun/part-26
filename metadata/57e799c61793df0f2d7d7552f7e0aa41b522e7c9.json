You can record, playback, overdub just like \nwith a tape multitrack recorder, but you can exploit the flexibility and power of \ntoday's PCs for applying effects, realtime input processing, automated aux channels\nsends and returns, destructive and non-destructive wave editing. The program \nsupports 24bit-192 khz recording, multiple channels soundcards, live input \nprocessing, mp3 encoding and much more.\n\nn-Track Studio - a full-featured multitrack audiostudiya, allowing you to create \nyour own professional-quality musical compositions. n-Track Studio works with most \naudio formats, allows to impose all sorts of effects on each track with listening \nin real time, to work with channels, correct synchronization, etc. In addition to \nthese standard effects like Reverb, Compression, EQ, Echo, Auto volume, Pitch Shift \nand Chorus, n-Track Studio allows you to use DirectX and VST 2.0 plug-ins from \nthird-party developers.\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Audio in all popular WAV file formats except 8-bit, as well as Ogg Vorbis\n- MIDI (with piano-roll editor)\n- DX/DXi/VST/VSTi plugins\n- Cut-paste editing\n- ASIO, WDM, and MME audio interfaces\n- Robust set of built-in effects (compressor, MB-compressor, parametric EQ, \n  reverb, auto-vol, pitch shift, echo, chorus, and tempo delay)\n- Spectrum analyzer\n- LIVE mode for hearing FX while recording\n- Multiple soundcards\n- Surround mixing\n- Automation of volume, pan, aux sends &amp; returns, and plugin FX parameters\n- ReWire technology by Propellerhead\n\n\n\nMain New Fatures:\n\n- Realtime crossfade between parts overlapped in timeline, crossfade option \n  in timeline popup menu\n- RMS Level meters, with RMS+Peak option and support for K-System metering.\n- Allows for more accurate metering of audio loudness and enables monitoring \n  using Bob Katz K-System, with presets for K-12, K-14 and K-20)\n- Signal Path View window\n  (Shows a realtime representation of the routing of audio signals in the audio \n  engine, enables to intuitively alter signal routing parameters and connections)\n- Support for Wave64 file format (Support for wave files that have length that \n  exceeds the 2 Gb limitation of regular .wav files, using either .wav or .w64 \n  extensions)\n- The program no longer requires Microsft .NET to be installed and the 'Enable \n  Microsoft .Net' setting in Preferences/Option can be disabled so that n-Track \n  will not use .NET even if it is installed on the computer.\n- Reduced resources usage: n-Track 6.0 starts faster than v5.x, uses less memory \n  and CPU\n\n\n\nPerformance Optimizations:\n\n- Performance improvements in recording/playback at low latencies\n- Speedup of most destructive wave editing operations (copy, cut, silence, \n  insert etc.)\n- Speedup generation of npk files used for displaying waveforms\n- Speedup in adding/removing tracks when using a multichannel soundcard and \n  Live input processing on\n\n\n\nEnhancements:\n\n- Duplicate waveform dragging while holding down Windows key\n- Per part volume knob in part properties box (that appears double clicking on \n  waveform). Volume adjustment is visually to waveform\n- Dragging a waveform beyond the end loops the wave file\n- Angled edges of waveform frame, more angled when waveform end is open or looped\n- Volume Envelopes: &quot;Click adds node&quot; toggle option to avoid inadvertedly adding \n  envelope nodes.

Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\nAlso scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware \ndetected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at October, 27 2009 - 09.45 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57e799c61793df0f2d7d7552f7e0aa41b522e7c9","amp;dn":"Fasoft+n-Track+Studio+v6.0.6.2521+%2B+Keys+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57e799c61793df0f2d7d7552f7e0aa41b522e7c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,231,153,198,23,147,223,15,45,125,117,82,247,224,170,65,181,34,231,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
