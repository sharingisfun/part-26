Besides providing music sheets arranged for piano, the book also includes lyrics in the original language of each country along with an English translation, if applicable. Non-Latin texts are also displayed as much as possible, usually coming with a transliterated version in the sheet music so that they can be sung. In addition to the anthems, each entry includes a quick fact box containing historical background of the country, facts about the nation itself, and a short account of how the song came to be the national anthem.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e71b67d31af84d3dbcf81628861402ec27b0420f","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+National+Anthems-SHAREGO.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e71b67d31af84d3dbcf81628861402ec27b0420f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,27,103,211,26,248,77,61,188,248,22,40,134,20,2,236,39,176,66,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
