Two years ago, a pair of thirty foot-long prehistoric crocodiles terrorized the residents of Lake Placid. While most of the locals assumed that the nightmare had ended when the murderous creatures were killed, local crocodile lover Sadie (Cloris Leachman) knows that the truth is far more terrifying. Beneath the surface of Lake Placid, the remaining predators have been quietly reproducing, awaiting the moment they will emerge from the water and cement their status on the top of the food chain. Now, as Sheriff Riley's rebellious teenage son (Shad Collins) departs for a relaxing lakeside camping trip, the desperate father realizes the danger that lies beneath the surface and races to confront a prehistoric predator that won't stop until it's consumed every last local.\n\n\nGspot Info~&gt;AVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Lake Placid 2 (2007)[Tabsman DVDRIP][H33T][Release].avi\nFilesize.....: 700 MB (or 716,874 KB or 734,078,976 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:24:07 (151,258 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1030 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \nFrame Size...: 640x368 (1.74:1) [=40:23]\n\n\nSubs~&gt;NO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6171e9bd6ea126e8c77aba72f8f1e67b0caf237e","amp;dn":"Lake+Placid+2+%282007%29%5BTabsman+DVDRIP%5D%5BH33T%5D%5BRelease%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6171e9bd6ea126e8c77aba72f8f1e67b0caf237e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,113,233,189,110,161,38,232,199,122,186,114,248,241,230,123,12,175,35,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
