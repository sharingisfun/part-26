Of course, this collection of rarities makes it a treasure \ntrove for the dedicated, since many of these songs haven't appeared on disc \nbefore, and a number of them are genuine finds, such as the alternate version of \n&quot;Domino Dancing,&quot; the original 7&quot; version of &quot;Opportunities,&quot; and Stephen \nHague's dance mix of &quot;Love Comes Quickly.&quot; These are just a couple of reasons \nwhy Essential Pet Shop Boys -- which was available as a limited-edition release \nin 1998 -- is essential for collectors. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and expecting a\nrelease, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and expressing this is\nlegitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80039514518c09f82743a344e524f7026229f124","amp;dn":"Pet+Shop+Boys+-+Essential+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80039514518c09f82743a344e524f7026229f124","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,3,149,20,81,140,9,248,39,67,163,68,229,36,247,2,98,41,241,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
