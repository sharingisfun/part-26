Richard H. Wilkinson's books include Reading Egyptian Art.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44350d2877ed71ab0ca62cec3b86812706308506","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Valley+of+the+Kings+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44350d2877ed71ab0ca62cec3b86812706308506","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,53,13,40,119,237,113,171,12,166,44,236,59,134,129,39,6,48,133,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
