Their eclectic approach to rock folds Tolkienian dragons-and-dwarves imagery into grand musical themes that draw on prog, metal, acid rock, and pastoral folk. The band were fairly popular in the U.K. in the '70s, and their albums charted respectably in the U.S. during this time as well. As the musical landscape shifted in the later '70s, the band's popularity died down, but they have continued to release albums--their live discography is rather lengthy--and tour, and remain popular in Eastern Europe and Japan.\n\ndisc 1\n1.
