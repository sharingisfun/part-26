October 2007.\n\nThe best of the best, from Essinth&amp;#039;s point of view. If the picture&amp;#039;s content is good, but drawn badly, it gets trashed. If the picture is drawn well but that&amp;#039;s just it - only drawn well, it gets trashed, too. So, over time, the collection just gets better.\n\nThe collection is categorised, 0 means non-adult and mostly safe for work, everything above - adult. Which category picture belongs to was intuitively chosen, no strict rules.\n\nNow this collection has an extra category set -- which starts with &quot;a&quot;. That used to be for anime-related art, but now it&amp;#039;s for anything that&amp;#039;s not furry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a18a7f01c8f8d378e24eebcd1357c277cb8b5ce3","amp;dn":"Essinth+Furryart+October+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a18a7f01c8f8d378e24eebcd1357c277cb8b5ce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,138,127,1,200,248,211,120,226,78,235,205,19,87,194,119,203,139,92,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
