The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b26658cc3629782e70211a8d4353ad7c2b0f041","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+Server+Advanced+4+-+SMP+-+7.029+-+English+-+CDROM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b26658cc3629782e70211a8d4353ad7c2b0f041","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,38,101,140,195,98,151,130,231,2,17,168,212,53,58,215,194,176,240,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
