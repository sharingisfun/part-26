Track 12 is my favorite and one of only three not sung by Steve Perry!\n\n\n* Fans take note, a new Steve Perry album is expected during 2010 and lets pray for a tour","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52d25e674eace79a86d9dc5eba952efdf6fcb148","amp;dn":"Journey%3A+Love+Songs+%5B1978-2008%5D+320Kbps+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52d25e674eace79a86d9dc5eba952efdf6fcb148","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,210,94,103,78,172,231,154,134,217,220,94,186,149,46,253,246,252,177,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
