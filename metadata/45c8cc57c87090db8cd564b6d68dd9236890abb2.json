Released both in the US and in Europe, with different covers.\n\nSee also the album Evocation: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4302622/(dark_ambient)_Ahasverus_-_Evocation_(2006)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4302622/(dark_ambient)_Ahasverus_-_Evocation_(2006)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews: \n\n\nAhasverus&amp;#039; third major work continues stilistically from where the divine Evocation (2006) left off, but is somewhat lighter. It is incredibly well building dark, beautiful ambient, the changes in which you can often anticipate, yet they&amp;#039;re still repeatedly admirable. The production-style is quite robust and the tracks flow nicely into one another even as they all stand alone as individual parts of the whole. At a couple of times the techniques used are rather superficial, yet those too are eventually turned into an advantage for the total work. Take a significant portion of strongest-era Lustmord (which this really quite often resembles, even a bit too much), add in a dash of Atrium Carceri, and you get a good idea of what this sounds album like. Yet it&amp;#039;s nevertheless quite original, and definitely a compositional work. The sole real weakness of Foundation is that Henrik Summanen has himself set his bar with Evocation so high, that this time he simply can&amp;#039;t rise to the level of that masterpiece.\n\nIncredibly good ambient, in the style of the old masters.\n\nkuolleenmusiikinyhdistys \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe CD &quot;Foundation&quot; is full of dark, spooky ambient music. If you are living on the edge, this is a perfect soundtrack. If your days are too long and boring, this album will make them exciting. Only 100 copies made so far.\n\nWyatting\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nI once knew someone who was firmly of the belief that people shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be wearing earphones and listening to music when walking on the street. He used to get rather upset about it. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPeople need to be alert at all times!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, he would rant, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNot making full uses of their senses when in the urban environment is a dereliction of their duty as a human! I could sneak up on them without them being aware!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. My more laissez-faire approach to portable music devices confounded him, and he moved to Japan (I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think I caused this, but you never know). IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m pretty sure he is a ninja now, the super-aware super-stealthy bastard.\n\nListening to this new album from Ahasverus (aka Swede Henrik Summanen) on earphones had a strange effect on me. In fact I felt super-aware, like I was perceiving the most minute sounds. I felt like a whale on legs. I could hear caterpillars munching on leaves in the trees. I could hear the heartbeats of those passing me in the streets, and even those sneaking up behind me with nefarious purpose in mind. I could hear moisture coalescing into thunder clouds. I could hear tectonic plates shifting under my feet. Foundation is reminiscent of the brilliant Elegi album on Miasmah last year; previously-repressed traces of string-based melody mingle with best-unidentified found sounds to increasingly discomfiting effect. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m new to the work of Ahasverus, but this record marks him out as worth following (a few paces behind, just beyond his field of vision).\n\nMapsadaisical \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45c8cc57c87090db8cd564b6d68dd9236890abb2","amp;dn":"%28dark+ambient%29+Ahasverus+-+Foundation+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45c8cc57c87090db8cd564b6d68dd9236890abb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,200,204,87,200,112,144,219,140,213,100,182,214,141,217,35,104,144,171,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
