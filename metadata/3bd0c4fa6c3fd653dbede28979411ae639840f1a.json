Amazingly, all these disparate strands came together in a groundbreaking, decades-spanning artistic career. Operating under the credo: Science is fiction, PainlevÃƒÂ© forged his own unique cinematic path, creating countless short films for both the viewing public and the scientific community. Moreover, he was also one of the first filmmakers to take his camera underwater. Surreal, otherworldly documents of marine life, these films transformed sea horses, octopi, and mollusks into delicate dancers in their own floating ballets. This anthology features twenty-three of PainlevÃƒÂ©'s shorts in their original form, as well as Yo La Tengo's ninety-minute original score The Sounds of Science, written in 2001 to accompany eight of the director's films.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bd0c4fa6c3fd653dbede28979411ae639840f1a","amp;dn":"Science+is+Fiction%EA%9E%89+23+Films+by+Jean+Painlev%26eacute%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bd0c4fa6c3fd653dbede28979411ae639840f1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,208,196,250,108,63,214,83,219,237,226,137,121,65,26,230,57,132,15,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
