For an album of only seven tracks, Brilliant Trees is an eclectic affair fusing funk, jazz, and ambient. Its best pieces are the moody jazz of &quot;Red Guitar,&quot; the dusky atmosphere of &quot;Weathered Wall,&quot; and &quot;Brilliant Trees&quot; itself, both of which feature the woozy trumpet of Eno collaborator and fourth-world pioneer Jon Hassell. The record also showcases guest players like Holger Czukay.   \n\n\nRecorded in late 1983 at Hansa tone Studios in Berlin with producer Steve Nye. A recording of considerable significance in David's output instigating as it does new working methods and a level of inquiry that radically broadened the emotional range and scope of his work. The cast of collaborators includes Ryuichi Sakamoto, Holger Czukay, Jon Hassell and Kenny Wheeler. Critically celebrated on its release Brilliant Trees went straight into the UK chart at number 4. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
