Lama &quot;Buddha_Mind&quot; (Kathmandu, Nepal)\n  \nThis is a excellent choice for anyone who likes to listen to different types of music. I highly recommend this cd since it carries all the sentimental value of Nepali music. One of the best CD in Sur Sudha&amp;#039;s entire history of music creation, I think. I own it, I love it, I play it very often. Go and just buy one, seriously you will not regret it. It has Sitar, Tabla and flute.\n\nA music lover.\n---------------------\n\nProduct Description\nA collection of melodies from Nepal including the following: Ghansi, Tamangselo, Sime Sime Panima, Mustang, Ratna and Bhairavi.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b9b19106aa7b5c696bf6288a781028438c1d162","amp;dn":"Sur+Sudha+Melodies+of+Nepal+-+flute+tabla+sitar+nepali+instrumen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b9b19106aa7b5c696bf6288a781028438c1d162","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,155,25,16,106,167,181,198,150,191,98,136,167,129,2,132,56,193,209,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
