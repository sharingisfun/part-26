In this workshop, professional developer Edward Tanguay shows you how to use these features and introduces you to a number of new, useful functions such as array_replace, date_add, new functions to work with ini files, and more. In addition to these new features of PHP, youÃ‚Â´ll also learn the basics of using cookies and regular expressions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:758247ccf92c5f8bdc6c617e09a68f8142deb1e6","amp;dn":"Video2Brain+-+Professional+PHP+%3A+Volume+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"758247ccf92c5f8bdc6c617e09a68f8142deb1e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,130,71,204,249,44,95,139,220,108,97,126,9,166,143,129,66,222,177,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
