Although seemingly unsung, Metamorphosen is a masterful work of 20th Century music. It can be heard as a requiem for Germanic culture, which lay in ruins when the piece was written in 1945. Very moving, indeed.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94721448c2e09c1826a75189388815055f92fa5f","amp;dn":"Strauss%2C+R.+-+Metamorphosen%2C+Sonatina+No.+1+for+winds+-+Previn%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94721448c2e09c1826a75189388815055f92fa5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,114,20,72,194,224,156,24,38,167,81,137,56,136,21,5,95,146,250,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
