Chris Norris commented in Spin: &quot;Aerosmith is as close to Hollywood as rock-n-roll gets. In their 25 years, the Boston crew of Tyler, Perry, guitarist Brad Whitford, bassist Tom Hamilton, and drummer Joey Kramer have gone from being the definitive 1970s hard-rock band to a textbook on economy, surliness, and soul to the ultimate comeback band brought back almost literally from the dead in the mid-1980s to the most bankable act in popular music.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09b597f1a3f5b1f74409510446332997d7182528","amp;dn":"Biography+HD+-+Aerosmith+%28Steven+Tyler%2C+Joe+Perry%2C+Brad+Whitford","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09b597f1a3f5b1f74409510446332997d7182528","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,181,151,241,163,245,177,247,68,9,81,4,70,51,41,151,215,24,37,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
