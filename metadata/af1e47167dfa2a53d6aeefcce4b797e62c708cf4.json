Red Buddha is the first document, and it is probably the least accessible, but nevertheless a stunning achievement as there is mostly just percussion instruments.\n\nWhile the execution of the music is stunning and very impressive, the compositions are anything but easy; with the tracks often nearing &quot;musique concrete&quot; with all of those tuned percussion instruments. The tracks are not improvisations, the music being clearly written and it was for the Red Buddha theatre in Paris. Difficult to describe this type of music, but it's sometimes dissonant, modern classical, percussive and exclusive of those not paying close attention to it.
