They featured Noel McCalla on lead vocals who went on to play in Partners In Crime and did vocals on one track on Trevor Rabin&amp;#039;s &quot;Wolf&quot; album.  They were signed to Epic and just released these two albums as far as I know.  I would put them in the same vein as Crawler, soulful classic rock.  I know Gary Moberley was credited as playing keyboards on one of the albums, maybe both.  He played keyboards for Sweet in the late 70s/early 80s.  I don&amp;#039;t think he was a member of the band.  Anyway, if you know Moon you don&amp;#039;t need me to give you all the info.  If you don&amp;#039;t, hope you have better luck finding stuff on them on the net than me.\n\nI have ripped these from vinyl but tidied up the overall sound with a bit of editing.  I have tried to do this as gently as possible.  Hope you enjoy the results.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4a32dc652aadd391a4196c66a9ef3650c8a8c7a","amp;dn":"MOON+%5BNoel+McCalla%5D+2+Albums+%5B70s+Funky+Soul+Classic+Rock%5D+Vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4a32dc652aadd391a4196c66a9ef3650c8a8c7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,163,45,198,82,170,221,57,26,65,150,198,106,158,243,101,12,138,140,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
