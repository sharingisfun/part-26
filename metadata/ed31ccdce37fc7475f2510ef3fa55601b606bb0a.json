The overall sound is much more Funkadelic than later Parliament, if with a somewhat more accessible feel. Things get going with an appropriately leering start, thanks to &quot;I Call My Baby Pussycat,&quot; which makes something like &quot;What's New, Pussycat?&quot; seem like innocent, chaste conversation. After a stripped-down start, things explode into a full-on funk strut with heavy-duty guitar and slamming drums setting the way, while the singers sound like they're tripping without losing the soul ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ sudden music dropouts, vocal cut-ins, volume level tweaks, and more add to the off-kilter feeling. Osmium's sound progresses from there ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it's funk's fire combined with a studio freedom that feels like a blueprint for the future. Bernie Worrell's keyboard abilities are already clear, whether he's trying for hotel lounge jams or full freakiness; similarly, Eddie Hazel is clearly finding his own epic stoned zone to peel out some amazing solos at the drop of a hat. As for the subject matter and end results ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ who else but this crew could have come up with the trash-talking, yodeling twang of &quot;Little Ol' Country Boy&quot; in 1970 and still made it funky with all the steel guitar? Other fun times include the piano and vocal-into-full band goofy romantic romp of &quot;My Automobile&quot; and &quot;Funky Woman,&quot; where over a heavy groove (and goofy Worrell break) the titular character lives with the consequence of her stank: &quot;She hung them in the air/The air said this ain't fair!&quot; Amidst all the nuttiness, there are some perhaps surprising depths ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ consider &quot;Oh Lord, Why Lord/Prayer,&quot; which might almost be too pretty for its own good (Worrell's harpsichord almost verges on the sickly sweet) but still has some lovely gospel choir singing and heartfelt lyrics. [This 2001 British reissue by Castle includes seven bonus tracks: &quot;Red Hot Mama,&quot; &quot;Breakdown,&quot; &quot;Come in out of the Rain,&quot; &quot;Fantasy Is Reality,&quot; &quot;Unfinished Instrumental,&quot; &quot;Loose Booty,&quot; and the &quot;Mono 45 Version&quot; of &quot;Breakdown.&quot;] \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed31ccdce37fc7475f2510ef3fa55601b606bb0a","amp;dn":"Parliament-Osmium...plus-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed31ccdce37fc7475f2510ef3fa55601b606bb0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,49,204,220,227,127,199,71,95,37,16,239,63,165,86,1,182,6,187,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
