For the first time, ISE design tools deliver 'intelligent'\n\nclock-gating technology that reduces dynamic power consumption by as\n\nmuch as 30 percent. The new suite also provides advances in\n\ntiming-driven design preservation, AMBA 4 AXI4-complaint IP support for\n\nplug-and-play design, and an intuitive design flow with\n\nfourth-generation partial reconfiguration capabilities that lowers\n\nsystem cost for a broad range of high performance applications.\n\n\n\nWith full production support for all Xilinx Virtex-6 and Spartan-6\n\nFPGA families, the ISE release continues its evolution as the\n\nindustry's only domain-specific design suite with interoperable design\n\nflows and tool configurations for logic, digital signal processing\n\n(DSP), embedded processing, and system-level design. In addition, Xilinx\n\nincorporated a number of software infrastructure and methodology\n\nenhancements that improve run time, streamline system integration, and\n\nexpand IP interoperability across its latest generation device families\n\nand Targeted Design Platforms.\n\n\n\nIntelligent Automation for Power Optimization\n\n\n\nISE Design Suite introduces the FPGA industry's first intelligent\n\nclock-gating technology with fully automated analysis and fine-grain\n\n(logic slice) optimization capabilities specifically developed to reduce\n\nthe number of transitions, a primary contributing factor of dynamic\n\npower dissipation in digital designs. The technology works by analyzing\n\ndesigns using a series of unique algorithms to detect sequential\n\nelements...\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.xilinx.com/tools/designtools.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.xilinx.com/tools/designtools.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n\n\nUnrar, burn/mount, install and select System Edition.
