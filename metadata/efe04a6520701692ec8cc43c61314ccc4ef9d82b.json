Vol 1 of 4 These are the songs each country is hoping to Win Eurovision with this year.   All Video's are HD and a mix of Live performance at the National Finals or the Studio Video and are again a mix of 720 or 1080 Pixel resolutions depending on the source.\r\n\r\nAll song entries have to be finalised by the 20th of March 2016 so obviously not all the songs are in yet, for example Malta (Ira Losco who came 2nd in 2002) have decided to work on there song some more, or even change it all together, which is allowed after the national final, yes as long as the winning artiste goes forward they can pick a better song if they have one.\r\n\r\nAll songs are in the universal MPEG2 format, so you can play them or import them into just about anything.  Talking of Malta, they are hosting the BBC Radio 1 Annie Mac Festival on the 31st of March to the 4th of April and are about to be invaded by thousands of bright young things from the UK for a big rave.  Perhaps this is there dress rehearsal for the day Malta wins Eurovision.  Now that is a Party I will want to go to...  The songs and countries in Vol 1 are listed below:  Enjoy. Vol 2 soon!\r\n\r\n\r\nDalal &amp; Deen Feat.
