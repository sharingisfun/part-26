Why? Because every single course out there pretty much only shows the Hebrew letters with no explaining of what they mean, so, if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how to read them, learning Hebrew will take a lot more time than necessary.\n\nWith these 17 videos you will learn how to write both the written version (handwriting), and the printed version (books) of the Hebrew characters. Included in the videos is also the Nikud system, where you with the help of dots and lines learn how to pronounce the Hebrew words.\n\nThe last three lessons are not released yet, and will only go through some famous Hebrew Bible verses, so you already have the whole writing and reading system in these first 17 videos.\n\nGood Luck!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7bced41adc42a3ee04166881b0168a2ba48150f","amp;dn":"HebrewPod101+Hebrew+Alphabet+Made+Easy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7bced41adc42a3ee04166881b0168a2ba48150f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,188,237,65,173,196,42,62,224,65,102,136,27,1,104,162,186,72,21,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
