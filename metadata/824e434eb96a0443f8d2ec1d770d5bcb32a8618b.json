W. Boag, P. E. Rubinin, D. Shoenberg \nHardcover: 448 pages\nPublisher: North-Holland (December 1990)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0444987533\nISBN-13: 978-0444987532\n\nThe unusual career of the famous Soviet physicist Peter Kapitza was divided between Cambridge and Moscow. In Cambridge he was a protege of Rutherford and while studying there he opened up a new area of research in magnetism and low temperature physics. However, in 1934, during a summer visit to the Soviet Union, Kapitza was prevented from returning to Cambridge and remained in Moscow for the rest of his long life. In spite of many ups and downs and considerable difficulties in his relations with top political figures in the Kremlin, he continued to enhance his scientific reputation and late in life was awarded the Nobel Prize. After an introductory biographical memoir, the greater part of the book consists of extracts from the numerous letters Kapitza wrote throughout his life, letters which are distinguished by their eloquence, the originality of his opinions and his forthrightness. His very interesting correspondence with Rutherford and above all his many letters to top political figures in the Soviet Union such as Molotov, Stalin and Khrushchev on questions of scientific and industrial policy are all included in this unique document","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:824e434eb96a0443f8d2ec1d770d5bcb32a8618b","amp;dn":"Life+and+Letters+of+a+Russian+Physicist+-+Kapitza+in+Cambridge+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"824e434eb96a0443f8d2ec1d770d5bcb32a8618b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,78,67,78,185,106,4,67,248,210,236,29,119,13,91,203,50,168,97,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
