No other applications are included.  When I tried to find these drivers it was more difficulty than I expected. When I tried to install the ones included in the watcher application they wouldn't work.  I eventually extracted them from the Telstra Connection Manager.  I have tested them with Sierra's 3g Watcher on XP &amp; Windows7.
