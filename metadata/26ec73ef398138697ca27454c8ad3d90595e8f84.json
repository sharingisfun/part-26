The group consists of Charles Bissell, Greg Whelan, Kevin Whelan, and Jerry MacDonald. Their debut album Silver was released in 1994. The band was plagued by label problems throughout the rest of the 1990s, leaving them unable to release an album for many years after Secaucus in 1996. The band&amp;#039;s third offering, The Meadowlands, finally surfaced in late 2003. The Wrens are currently being filmed for a documentary by the production company Little Quill.\nThe Meadowlands, the third studio album by The Wrens, was released by Absolutely Kosher Records on September 9, 2003. Due to troubles with The Wrens&amp;#039; label Grass Records (now Wind-up Records), The Wrens were put on a very long hiatus. Finally, The Meadowlands was released seven years after Secaucus. It was subsequently released in Europe by LO-MAX Records.\n[/quote]\n\n\nTracks:\n\n&quot;The House That Guilt Built&quot; ? 1:22 \n&quot;Happy&quot; ? 5:33 \n&quot;She Sends Kisses&quot; ? 5:57 \n&quot;This Boy Is Exhausted&quot; ? 4:17 \n&quot;Hopeless&quot; ? 5:08 \n&quot;Faster Gun&quot; ? 3:50 \n&quot;Thirteen Grand&quot; ? 4:09 \n&quot;Boys, You Won&amp;#039;t Remember&quot; ? 4:29 \n&quot;Ex-Girl Collection&quot; ? 4:39 \n&quot;Per Second Second&quot; ? 3:38 \n&quot;Everyone Choose Sides&quot; ? 4:39 \n&quot;13 Months in 6 Minutes&quot; ? 6:50 \n&quot;This Is Not What You Had Planned&quot; ? 1:37 \n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26ec73ef398138697ca27454c8ad3d90595e8f84","amp;dn":"The+Wrens+-+The+Meadowlands+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26ec73ef398138697ca27454c8ad3d90595e8f84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,236,115,239,57,129,56,105,124,162,116,84,200,173,61,144,89,94,143,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
