(1998)\n\nIMDB Link:\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133189/\n\n----\n\nA request for &quot;Regina&quot;...Here it is.  Can't believe this movie wasn't already on here.  The only movie which address the whole &quot;scene&quot; at once, and from the 80's at that.  Vespas, mods, and all the shit that pisses me off. A very good movie.\n\n----\n\nMini Plot:\n\nTwo punks live in Salt Lake City. The film covers their all-day routine. The realism of the character-narrated movie may be discussed. One of the punks gets ill, stays in hospital for three weeks, comes out again. Three parties are covered and one concert including a fight between punks, rednecks and others.\n\n----\n\nEncoded by: sickboy88\nCodec: DivX 5.2 \nBitrate: 864 kb/s AVG\nAspect: 640x272 = 2.35:1\nAudio: Enlgish, 128 VBR Stereo @ 48K Hz\nSubtitles: None\nRuntime: 01:37:44\nFPS: 23.976","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:014700001a65cc94b9fd32b63a784824c5065b55","amp;dn":"SLC_Punk+%28divx52-sickboy88%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"014700001a65cc94b9fd32b63a784824c5065b55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,71,0,0,26,101,204,148,185,253,50,182,58,120,72,36,197,6,91,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
