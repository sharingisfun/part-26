H. Auden, Aldous Huxley, T. S. Eliot, Walt Disney, Edward G. Robinson, Charlie Chaplin, Woody Herman, even Zsa Zsa Gabor.\n\nAmong other things, then, these lectures on Stravinsky will give you a sense of the kaleidoscopic changes in musical expression that took place during the first 70 years of the 20th century. \n\n\n8 Lectures\n45 minutes / lecture\n\n1    Introduction and There's No Place Like Home \n2    From Student to Professional \n3    The Rite of Spring \n4    The War Years (WWI) \n5    Neoclassicism \n6    Maturity \n7    A Citizen of the World \n8    The New Stravinsky \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c6235501039d5cd72c8c906a93ab18df8854378","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Great+Masters+-+Stravinsky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c6235501039d5cd72c8c906a93ab18df8854378","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,98,53,80,16,57,213,205,114,200,201,6,169,58,177,141,248,133,67,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
