Ex-Mercyland bassist David Barbe and ex-Zulus/ ex-Human Sexual Response drummer Malcolm Travis rounded out the trio. Mould envisioned Sugar as a similar musical venture to HÃƒÂ¼sker DÃƒÂ¼ except with him writing all the songs and calling all the shots. Their sound was more radio-friendly than that of HÃƒÂ¼sker DÃƒÂ¼, though with similarly dark undertones.\n\nTheir first live show was February 20, 1992, at the 40 Watt Club in Athens, GA, after a few weeks warming up in R.E.M.&amp;#039;s downtown practice space. It was a &quot;secret&quot; show, not advertised in the local media, bumping Athens band Roosevelt from headliner to opener. Word got out and the club was packed.\n\nLater in 1992, the band released the album Copper Blue, which was named Album Of The Year 1992 by the NME. The following year they released Beaster, an EP of darker material recorded during the Copper Blue sessions. The single &quot;If I Can&amp;#039;t Change Your Mind&quot; was a moderate UK hit.\n\nCopper Blue was the debut album of the US band Sugar. It was voted 1992 album of the year by the NME. All of the songs were written by guitarist/vocalist Bob Mould, who also co-produced with Lou Giordano. The song &quot;The Slim&quot; is about losing someone to AIDS.\n\nSeveral tracks were recorded for this album, but were not included. Mould decided to release them separately as an EP entitled Beaster.\nIn 2006, the band Train featured a cover of &quot;If I Can&amp;#039;t Change Your Mind&quot; on its For Me, It&amp;#039;s You album.\n[/quote]\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n&quot;The Act We Act&quot; ? 5:10 \n&quot;A Good Idea&quot; ? 3:47 \n&quot;Changes&quot; ? 5:01 \n&quot;Helpless&quot; ? 3:05 \n&quot;Hoover Dam&quot; ? 5:27 \n&quot;The Slim&quot; ? 5:14 \n&quot;If I Can&amp;#039;t Change Your Mind&quot; ? 3:18 \n&quot;Fortune Teller&quot; ? 4:27 \n&quot;Slick&quot; ? 4:59 \n&quot;Man on the Moon&quot; ? 4:32\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a88da52f5ae3aa808f6770a5c110b55fe9095371","amp;dn":"Sugar+-+Copper+Blue+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a88da52f5ae3aa808f6770a5c110b55fe9095371","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,141,165,47,90,227,170,128,143,103,112,165,193,16,181,95,233,9,83,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
