Smith is a rock critic's dream, a poet as steeped in '60s garage rock as she is in French Symbolism; &quot;Land&quot; carries on from the Doors' &quot;The End,&quot; marking her as a successor to Jim Morrison, while the borrowed choruses of &quot;Gloria&quot; and &quot;Land of a Thousand Dances&quot; are more in tune with the era of sampling than they were in the '70s. Producer John Cale respected Smith's primitivism in a way that later producers did not, and the loose, improvisatory song structures worked with her free verse to create something like a new spoken word/musical art form: Horses was a hybrid, the sound of a post-Beat poet, as she put it, &quot;dancing around to the simple rock &amp; roll song.&quot;\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mgkylwQuf71qh2nndo1_1358108090_cover.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mgkylwQuf71qh2nndo1_1358108090_cover.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n1. &quot;Gloria\n2. &quot;Redondo Beach&quot;\n3. &quot;Birdland&quot;\n4. &quot;Free Money&quot;\n5. &quot;Kimberly&quot;\n6. &quot;Break It Up&quot;\n7. &quot;Land&quot;\nPart I: &quot;Horses&quot;\nPart II: &quot;Land of a Thousand Dances&quot;\nPart III: &quot;La Mer(de)&quot;\n8. &quot;Elegie&quot;\n\nCD bonus track\n\n9. &quot;My Generation (Live)&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1134f9d484baa8912ec99febea8be058439f6c5","amp;dn":"Patti+Smith+-+Horses+%5BFLAC%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1134f9d484baa8912ec99febea8be058439f6c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,19,79,157,72,75,170,137,18,236,153,254,190,168,190,5,132,57,246,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
