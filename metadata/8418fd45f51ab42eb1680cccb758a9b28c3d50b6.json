The scholarship of medieval architecture has traditionally imposed a division between military and ecclesiastical structures. Often, however, medieval churches were provided with fortified enclosures, crenellations, iron-barred doors and other elements of defence, demonstrating the strong link between Church and state, and the military and religious realms. In her study of fortress-churches, Sheila Bonde focuses on three twelfth-century monuments in southern France - Maguelone, Agde and Saint-Pon-de-ThomiÃƒÂ¨re, which are among the earliest examples of the type. She analyses her archaeological surveys of these structures, and also re-examines their documentation, which is here presented both in the original Latin and in English translations. The book also explores the larger context of fortification and authority in twelfth-century Languedoc and examines the dynamics of architectural exchange and innovation in the Mediterranean at a moment of critical historical importance.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ First book to deal exclusively with fortified churches and to deal with them in the context of the relationship between religious and military realms Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Contains original texts and new translations of Latin documents relating to the construction and history of the structures discussed Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Author is both a professor of art history and an archaeologist co-director of a dig at Soissons for the past ten years","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8418fd45f51ab42eb1680cccb758a9b28c3d50b6","amp;dn":"Fortress+-+Churches+of+Languedoc+-+Architecture%2C+Religion%2C+and+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8418fd45f51ab42eb1680cccb758a9b28c3d50b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,24,253,69,245,26,180,46,177,104,12,204,183,88,169,178,140,61,80,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
