Also if you use your PC to watch it, installing LAV Filter will help you a lot if you want to use KMPlayer or PotPlayer. However, MPC-HC (preferably in K-Lite Media Codec Pack) is the recommended. Many updated players have native support for the codec. To play on Android, use MX Player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac71f3c89c1d652a6cfc13fc94f1bd720cf7590b","amp;dn":"ReadyOrNotHereICum+Harmony+Reigns+720p+HEVC+x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac71f3c89c1d652a6cfc13fc94f1bd720cf7590b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,113,243,200,156,29,101,42,108,252,19,252,148,241,189,114,12,247,89,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
