(see proof of blackbars.png if you do not believe us!!) there was 9 variations, some small some big, to avoid our release having these horrible back bars, or ruening the aspect ratio, after cropping the back bars, each of the 9 parts differently!! we encoded the video to  540x254... yes we know 640x362 is the norm but again that would have caused horrible back bars...\n\nSecond it was syncing the english audio with the video, It Synced Up\nVery Well i must say\n\nVideo was pritty much ok, if you wish Feel Free to Use our Synced Audio,\nto save yourselves time, please give us Credit in your nfos for the release.\n\nScreenshots &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/9660/screenshot1ap.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/9660/screenshot1ap.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/2521/screenshot2dk.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/2521/screenshot2dk.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b11ba0f3abd7bca666146e0768adbec5e78092fe","amp;dn":"Alvin+and+the+Chipmunks+2+The+Squeakquel+CAM+ENG+-+F4U","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b11ba0f3abd7bca666146e0768adbec5e78092fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,27,160,243,171,215,188,166,102,20,110,7,104,173,190,197,231,128,146,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
