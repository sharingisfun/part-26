The group consists of the Corr siblings: Andrea (lead vocals, tin whistle); Sharon (violin, vocals); Caroline (drums, piano, bodhrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n, vocals); and Jim (guitar, piano, vocals).\nThe Corrs came to international prominence with their performance at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, and their support of Celine Dion on her 1996 Falling into You Tour. Since then, they have released five studio albums and numerous singles, which have reached platinum in many countries. Talk on Corners, their most successful album to date, reached multi-platinum status in Australia and the UK.\nThe Corrs have been actively involved in philanthropic activities. They have performed in numerous charity concerts such as the Prince's Trust in 2004 and Live 8 alongside Bono in 2005. The same year, they were awarded honorary MBEs for their contributions to music and charity. The Corrs are on hiatus because Jim and Caroline are raising families, while Andrea and Sharon are pursuing solo careers. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Corrs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Corrs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Works (CD 1) - The Corrs\nreleased 2007\n\n01  The Corrs - Runaway\n02  The Corrs - Dreams\n03  The Corrs - What Can I Do\n04  The Corrs - Irresistible\n05  The Corrs - I Never Loved You Anyway\n06  The Corrs - Love To Love You\n07  The Corrs - Forgiven Not Forgotten\n08  The Corrs - Leave Me Alone\n09  The Corrs - Secret Life\n10  The Corrs - The Right Time\n11  The Corrs - Heaven Knows\n12  The Corrs - Someday\n13  The Corrs - Closer\n14  The Corrs - When He's Not Around\n15  The Corrs - Don't Say You Love Me\n16  The Corrs - Love Gives Love Takes\n17  The Corrs - Hopelessly Addicted\n18  The Corrs - Erin Shore (Instrumental)\n\nThe Works (CD 2) - The Corrs\nreleased 2007\n\n01  The Corrs - Breathless\n02  The Corrs - So Young\n03  The Corrs - Radio\n04  The Corrs - Give Me A Reason\n05  The Corrs - Only When I Sleep\n06  The Corrs - Intimacy\n07  The Corrs - Queen Of Hollywood\n08  The Corrs - No Good For Me\n09  The Corrs - Little Wing\n10  The Corrs - All The Love In The World\n11  The Corrs - All In A Day\n12  The Corrs - At Your Side\n13  The Corrs - No More Cry\n14  The Corrs - Give It All Up\n15  The Corrs - Say\n16  The Corrs - One Night\n17  The Corrs - Rain\n18  The Corrs - Hurt Before\n19  The Corrs - Rebel Heart\n\nThe Works (CD 3) - The Corrs\nreleased 2007\n\n01  The Corrs - Summer Sunshine\n02  The Corrs - Angel\n03  The Corrs - Long Night\n04  The Corrs - Old Town\n05  The Corrs - Heart Like A Wheel\n06  The Corrs - Black Is The Colour\n07  The Corrs - Haste To The Wedding\n08  The Corrs - No Frontiers\n09  The Corrs - Love In The Milkyway\n10  The Corrs - Looking In The Eyes Of Love\n11  The Corrs - Somebody For Someone (Acoustic)\n12  The Corrs - No More Cry (Acoustic)\n13  The Corrs - At Your Side (Acoustic)\n14  The Corrs - When The Stars Go Blue (Feat.
