Originally written by Patrick Leonard for the soundtrack of the film Fire with Fire, the song was shown to Madonna, who decided to use it for then-husband Sean Penn's film At Close Range. It was produced by Leonard and Madonna for her third studio album True Blue, released in mid-1986, later appearing as a remix  on the 1990 compilation album The Immaculate Collection, in its original form on the 1995 ballads compilation album Something to Remember, and most recently on her third compilation album Celebration (again in its original form), released in September 2009.\n\nThe song includes instrumentation from guitars, keyboards, drums and a synthesizer, and its lyrics deals with deceit, mistrust and childhood scars. The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's first image makeover, featuring her with a cleaner look, shoulder-length wavy golden blond hair and subtle make-up.\n\nReleased as the album's first single in March 1986, the song was a commercial success. It became Madonna's third number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, and her first number-one on the Adult Contemporary chart. It was generally well-received by music critics, who frequently referred to it as the best ballad of her career. The song faced controversy when Madonna performed it on her 2006 Confessions Tour wearing a crown of thorns while hanging on a giant mirrored cross. The performance at Rome's Olympic Stadium was condemned as an act of hostility toward the Roman Catholic Church by religious leaders.\n\nIn 1986 Madonna starred in the film Shanghai Surprise, where she toned down her appearance, inspired again by Marilyn Monroe. Madonna held the look for the &quot;Live to Tell&quot; video. In it her make-up was pale and subtle, her shoulder-length hair was wavy and golden blond, and her clothes consisted in a simple 1930s-style floral dress. In an interview with music critic Stephen Holden from The New York Times, she commented about her new look:\n\n    After a while I got sick of wearing tons of jewelryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½I wanted to clean myself off. I see my new look as very innocent and feminine and unadorned. It makes me feel good. Growing up, I admired the kind of beautiful glamorous womanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from Brigitte Bardot to Grace KellyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who doesn't seem to be around much anymore. I think it's time for that kind of glamor to come back.\n\nIn addition to At Close Range, Foley also directed the song's video. David Naylor and Sharon Oreck were in charge of the production. The video serves as a publicity campaign for the movie, as it includes brief scenes of the film that indicate the conflict the young man in the movieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½played by Sean PennÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½feels.\n\nThe locations in the movie are separated visually from the shots of Madonna, who is singing in a darkened studio. Unlike her previous videos, Madonna portrays a narrator, whose song comments on the story, appearing in shots completely different from the narrative action. She appears to speak for the character, addressing his problems directly, like the chorus of a classical tragedy.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46645edddfe386c9639b0ade2bf0762f5dee7dfb","amp;dn":"Madonna+-+Live+To+Tell++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46645edddfe386c9639b0ade2bf0762f5dee7dfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,100,94,221,223,227,134,201,99,155,10,222,43,240,118,47,93,238,125,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
