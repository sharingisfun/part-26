Scheer had concluded that it is technically and environmentally feasible to harness enough solar radiation to achieve a total replacement of the foclear (fossil/nuclear) energy system by a global renewable energy economy. The main obstacle to such a change is seen to be political, not technical or economic.[2] In 1999 he was one of the initiators of the German feed-in tariffs that were the major source of the rise of renewable energies in Germany during the following years.\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39b34ef68e5717f4c4dd44381bab0bb26d8cd023","amp;dn":"The+Energy+Imperative+%282010%2C+mp3%29+Hermann+Scheer+-+Leader+German","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39b34ef68e5717f4c4dd44381bab0bb26d8cd023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,179,78,246,142,87,23,244,196,221,68,56,27,171,11,178,109,140,208,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
