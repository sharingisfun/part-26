So where is it? Well, for reasons this book makes crystal clear, that pill will never be the answerÃ¢â‚¬â€but as a result of the research thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone into it, scientists in the last few years have learned more about how womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sexuality works than we ever thought possible, and Come as You Are explains it all.\n\nThe first lesson in this essential, transformative book by Dr. Emily Nagoski is that every woman has her own unique sexuality, like a fingerprint, and that women vary more than men in our anatomy, our sexual response mechanisms, and the way our bodies respond to the sexual world. So we never need to judge ourselves based on othersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ experiences. Because women vary, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s normal.\n\nSecond lesson: sex happens in a context. And all the complications of everyday life influence the context surrounding a womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arousal, desire, and orgasm.\n\nCutting-edge research across multiple disciplines tells us that the most important factor for women in creating and sustaining a fulfilling sex life, is not what you do in bed or how you do it, but how you feel about it. Which means that stress, mood, trust, and body image are not peripheral factors in a womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sexual wellbeing; they are central to it. Once you understand these factors, and how to influence them, you can create for yourself better sex and more profound pleasure than you ever thought possible.\n\nAnd Emily Nagoski can prove it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8ef469115631823c5de994b7cf46b36e737f813","amp;dn":"Come+as+You+Are+%282015%29.Epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8ef469115631823c5de994b7cf46b36e737f813","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,239,70,145,21,99,24,35,197,222,153,75,124,244,107,54,231,55,248,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
