As bassist with the Ellington band at the start of the 1940s, Blanton introduced the idea of soloing on the bass, and the concept thereafter found its way into the palette of the band. Ellington and Brown revisit some of the compositional results here, and create some new ones, namely the four movement &quot;Fragmented Suite for Piano and Bass.&quot; The sympathetic interplay between these two masters is rendered that much deeper by the gorgeous tone each evokes from his respective instrument.\n\nPersonnel: Duke Ellington (piano); Ray Brown (bass).\nRecorded at Unite Recording, Las Vegas, Nevada on December 5, 1972\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.Do Nothin&amp;#039; Till You Hear From Me - 5:30\n2.Pitter Panther Patter - 3:00\n3.Things Ain&amp;#039;t What They Used to Be -3:56\n4.Sophisticated Lady -5:22\n5.See See Rider -3:04\n6.Fragmented Suite for Piano and Bass:First Movement -4:47\n7.Fragmented Suite for Piano and Bass:Second Movement - 5:07\n8.Fragmented Suite for Piano and Bass:Third Movement -3:35\n9.Fragmented Suite for Piano and Bass:Fourth Movement - 4:55","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71069cf2abf4232c420a6a05f858fd748913e872","amp;dn":"Duke+Ellington+and+Ray+Brown+-+This+Ones+for+Blanton+%281972%29+RESE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71069cf2abf4232c420a6a05f858fd748913e872","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,6,156,242,171,244,35,44,66,10,106,5,248,88,253,116,137,19,232,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
