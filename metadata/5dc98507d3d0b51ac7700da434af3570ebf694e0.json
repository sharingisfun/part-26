It dates its origins to 1970, when Benny Binion invited seven of the best-known poker players to the Horseshoe Casino for a single tournament, with a set start and stop time, and a winner determined by secret ballot.\n\nThe winner of each event receives a World Series of Poker bracelet and a monetary prize based on the number of entrants and buy-in amounts. Over the years, the tournament has grown in both the number of events and in the number of participants. Each year, the WSOP culminates with the $10,000 no-limit hold'em &quot;Main Event,&quot; which, since 2004, has attracted entrants numbering in the thousands. The victor receives a multi-million dollar cash prize and a bracelet, which has become the most coveted award a poker player can win. The winner of the World Series of Poker Main Event is considered to be the World Champion of Poker.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dc98507d3d0b51ac7700da434af3570ebf694e0","amp;dn":"World.Series.Of.Poker.2012.e26.HR.HDTV.XviD-AT.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dc98507d3d0b51ac7700da434af3570ebf694e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,201,133,7,211,208,181,26,199,112,13,164,52,175,53,112,235,246,148,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
