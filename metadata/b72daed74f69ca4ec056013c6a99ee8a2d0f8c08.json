Rex on RESIDENT ALIEN. \nA few songs, like &quot;Starside,&quot; sound uncannily like early Bowie, complete with spaceship sound effects. \nHowever, Spacehog goes far beyond just retro appeal, partly because of their refusal to take themselves seriously. \nEven their most hostile, snarling lyrics are bursting with wit, and the glittery surface of their music is simply the slick icing on top of a substantial cake made of gritty, rocking guitar and solid drum work.\n\nThe icing includes Royston Langdon's theatrical vocals and strutting, stylish songwriting, which includes tongue-in-cheek lyrics like &quot;So if you raise a glass/To love you passed/Raise a glass to me&quot; (from &quot;Shipwrecked&quot;). \nSpacehog enjoys this kind of melodramatic posing, both in their lyrics and in their music, but they don't lose track of a song's dynamics, and their strong sense of timing lends a sharp edge to each track, never allowing its essence \nto get lost in the zealous glitter.\n\nLive Recording\n\nRecorded at Bearsville Studios, New York.\n\nSpacehog: \nRoyston Langdon (vocals, bass, Moog, Hammond B-3, synthesizer); \nAntony Langdon (guitar, vocals, synthesizer, Hammond B-3, Moog); \nRichard Steel (guitar); \nJonny Cragg (drums, percussion, background vocals).\n\nAdditional personnel: Sean (background vocals).\n\nLinage: CD &gt; EAC &gt; flac\n\nIncluded: NFO, PLS, M3U, LOG, CUE\nCovers: Front \nTags: VorbisComment\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01.
