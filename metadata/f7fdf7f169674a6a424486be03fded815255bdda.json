Her first single, \n\\&quot;Locomotion\\&quot;, spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles chart and became the highest selling single \nof the decade. This led to a contract with songwriters and producers Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman. Her debut album, Kylie \n(1988), and the single \\&quot;I Should Be So Lucky\\&quot;, each reached number one in the United Kingdom, and over the next two \nyears, her first 13 singles reached the British top ten. Her debut film, The Delinquents (1989) was a box-office hit \nin Australia and the UK despite negative reviews.\n\nInitially presented as a \\&quot;girl next door\\&quot;, Minogue attempted to convey a more mature style in her music and public \nimage. Her singles were well received, but after four albums her record sales were declining, and she left Stock, \nAitken &amp; Waterman in 1992 to establish herself as an independent performer. Her next single, \\&quot;Confide in Me\\&quot;, \nreached number one in Australia and was a hit in several European countries in 1994, and a duet with Nick Cave, \n\\&quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow\\&quot;, brought Minogue a greater degree of artistic credibility. Drawing inspiration from a \nrange of musical styles and artists, Minogue took creative control over the songwriting for her next album, \nImpossible Princess (1997). It failed to attract strong reviews or sales in the UK, but was successful in Australia.\n\nMinogue returned to prominence in 2000 with the single \\&quot;Spinning Around\\&quot; and the dance-oriented album Light Years, \nand she performed during the closing ceremonies of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Her music videos showed a more sexually \nprovocative and flirtatious personality and several hit singles followed. \\&quot;Can\\'t Get You Out of My Head\\&quot; reached number \none in more than 40 countries, and the album Fever (2001) was a hit in many countries, including the United States, a \nmarket in which Minogue had previously received little recognition. Minogue embarked on a concert tour but cancelled \nit when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2005. After surgery and chemotherapy treatment, she resumed her \ncareer in 2006 with Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour. Her tenth studio album X was released in 2007 and was followed by \nthe KylieX2008 tour. In 2009, she embarked upon her For You, For Me Tour, her first concert tour of the United States \nand Canada, and the following year released her eleventh studio album, Aphrodite.\n\nMinogue has achieved worldwide record sales of more than 60 million, and has received notable music awards, including \nmultiple ARIA and Brit Awards and a Grammy Award. She has mounted several successful concert tours and received a Mo \nAward for \\&quot;Australian Entertainer of the Year\\&quot; for her live performances. She was awarded the Order of the British \nEmpire \\&quot;for services to music\\&quot;, and an Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2008.\n\n\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFile size : 8.83 MiB\nDuration : 3mn 51s\nOverall bit rate : 320 Kbps\nAlbum : Kylie Hits\nTrack name : Can\\'t Get You Out Of My Head\nTrack name/Position : 1\nPerformer : Kylie Minogue\nAccompaniment : Kylie Minogue\nRecorded date : 2011\nWriting library : LAME3.97 \nComment : www.NewAlbumReleases.net\n\nAudio\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nMode extension : MS Stereo\nDuration : 3mn 51s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nStream size : 8.83 MiB (100%)\nWriting library : LAME3.97 \nEncoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 20.5","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7fdf7f169674a6a424486be03fded815255bdda","amp;dn":"Kylie+Minogue+Kylie+Hits+%282011%29+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7fdf7f169674a6a424486be03fded815255bdda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,253,247,241,105,103,74,106,66,68,134,190,3,253,237,129,82,85,189,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
