Peak poses include Flying Pigeon, or Eka Pada Galavasana, and Crane Pose, or Bakasana. Flying Pigeon could be described as an extreme variation of the headstand, and it strengthens the wrists, shoulders, arms, and core while stretching the legs and hips. It is also believed to help with balance and digestive function. Crane Pose is another wrist-centric posture, and is designed to open the groins, tone the abdominal organs, and strengthen the arms and wrists.\n\nJoin Lauren and get started on improving your balance!\n\nLevel: Intermediate\nStyle: Power, Vinyasa\nFocus: Cardio, Arm Balances, Super Sweaty Flow, Hips, Balancing Poses, Strength\n\nVideo; x264; 1280*720 (16:9); 1818 kbps; 23.976 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcaf46550473d9f126b8d37723385175ee813dc9","amp;dn":"Lauren+Eckstrom+Yoga+-+For+the+Love+of+Balance+40+min+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcaf46550473d9f126b8d37723385175ee813dc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,175,70,85,4,115,217,241,38,184,211,119,35,56,81,117,238,129,61,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
