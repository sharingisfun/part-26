When his father dies, it is up to him to organize his funeral. On this painful morning, the suitable grave expression on his face, Daniel is ready to welcome his father's friends and relatives. But preserving the dignity inherent in such circumstances will be a hard task. Particularly with an undertaker who botches his work, the return from the USA of his famous but selfish brother, his cousin's fiancÃƒÂ© who has accidentally ingested drugs, the presence a moron who takes advantage of the sad event to win back the heart (or rather the body) of a woman who is about to marry another, of a handicapped old uncle who is also the most unbearable pain in the neck. To cap it all, Daniel notices the presence among the mourners of a mysterious dwarf nobody else seems to know\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795368/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795368/&lt;/a&gt;\nGenre:Comedy\nUser Rating:7.3/10\n\n\n \nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 28mn\nBit rate : 1 789 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 304 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.35:1\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nResolution : 8 bits\nColorimetry : 4:2:0\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.327\nStream size : 1.11 GiB (80%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nCodec ID : 2000\nDuration : 1h 28mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nStream size : 284 MiB (20%)\nAlignment : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 500 ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:454eac2a34918ba97a94e620dc7d1a7c55da2edb","amp;dn":"Death.At.A.Funeral.2010.DVDRip.XviD.AC3-Rx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"454eac2a34918ba97a94e620dc7d1a7c55da2edb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,78,172,42,52,145,139,169,122,148,230,32,220,125,26,124,85,218,46,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
