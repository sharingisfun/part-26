Heâ€™s done it with aggressive musicality and consistently\r\ninventive drumming, combining drive and subtlety. He has also recorded his\r\ncompositions with his own quartet and the collective Drumheller. His latest CD\r\nwill introduce his talents to a far wider audience: Too Many Continents (Clean\r\nFeed CF336, cleanfeed-records.com) appears on the most active free jazz label\r\nin the world and presents Fraser at the heart of a trio with expatriate\r\nCanadian pianist Kris Davis and saxophonist Tony Malaby, two key figures in\r\ncurrent NYC jazz activity.

Episodes of extended free improvisation are separated by Fraserâ€™s\r\ncompositions, among which the moody, corrosive Also stands out.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Peter Gough \nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2015/08/nick-fraser-feat-kris-davis-tony-malaby.html\r\n\r\nBy Grego Applegate Edwards\r\n\r\nBy Jan Granlie (no) \nhttp://salt-peanuts.eu/record/nick-fraser/\r\n\r\nBy Stefano Merighi (it) \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/too-many-continents-nick-fraser-clean-feed-records-review-by-stefano-merighi.php\r\n\r\nPar Julien Gros-Burdet (fr) \nhttp://www.citizenjazz.com/Nick-Fraser.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73d37fb02e5f99df94d1e11f3dc35bba923eba19","amp;dn":"Nick+Fraser%2C+Tony+Malaby%2C+Kris+Davis+-Too+Many+Continents+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73d37fb02e5f99df94d1e11f3dc35bba923eba19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,211,127,176,46,95,153,223,148,209,225,31,61,195,91,186,146,62,186,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
