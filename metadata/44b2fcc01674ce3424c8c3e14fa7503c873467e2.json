They wait for dark, trading insults and even finding some common ground; sometimes one has the gun, sometimes the other, sometimes both. Things get complicated when another wounded Bosnian comes to, but can't move because a bouncing mine is beneath him. The two men cooperate to wave white flags, their lines call the UN (whose high command tries not to help), an English reporter shows up, a French sergeant shows courage, and the three men in no man's land may or may not find a way to all get along.\n\nLanguages : Bosnian / English / French / German\n\nSubs srt: English / Portuguese ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44b2fcc01674ce3424c8c3e14fa7503c873467e2","amp;dn":"No+Man+s+Land+2001+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44b2fcc01674ce3424c8c3e14fa7503c873467e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,178,252,192,22,116,206,52,36,200,195,225,79,167,80,60,135,52,103,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
