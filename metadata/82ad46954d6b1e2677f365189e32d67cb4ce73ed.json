The band appeared along with many well known names such as Kenny Ball, Acker Bilk and the Alex Welsh Band, and made guest appearances on local radio programmes.\nWhen the so-called traditional jazz boom faded, Carol started working in cabaret and clubs, however it wasn't long before she realised that this type of work was not for her and gave up singing for about four years.\nIn the mid-seventies, the well known Glasgow musician and band leader Jimmy Feighan coaxed her out of retirement and invited her to sing at his Saturday lunchtime venue.  She stayed for seven years.  During this time a musical association with the pianist Sandy Taylor developed, and with drummer Murray Smith and bassist Alex Moore, the trio on this album was established and became the mainstay of her backing for many years.\nA television appearance on the Annie Ross Jazz Series caught the attention of the late Pat Smythe, who arranged a two-week stint at Ronnie Scott's.  Three more appearances followed - enough said!\nIn between times, such notables as George Chisholm, Buck Clayton, Eddie Thomson, Humphrey Littleton, Cliff Hardie, Bob Brookmeyer and Martin Taylor, have been pleased to work alongside and enthuse about her singing.  The BBC Scotland, BBC London and NOS (Hilversum) Radio Orchestras have regularly requested Carol to take up her position in the vocal booth, for broadcasts covering Britain and Europe. \n\nTrack list:\n01.
