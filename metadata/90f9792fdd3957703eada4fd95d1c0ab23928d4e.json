The song was written by Phil Spector, along with Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich, with the intentions of being sung by Ronnie Spector of The Ronettes. According to Darlene Love, Ronnie Spector was not able to put as much emotion into the song as needed, so Love was brought into the studio to record the song instead, which eventually became a big success.\n\nThe song was not widely recognized after its initial release; however, it has since been covered many times by different artists over the years. The first cover was recorded by U2 in July 1987 during a soundcheck at a stop during their Joshua Tree Tour in Glasgow, Scotland. Darlene Love provided backing vocals for U2, and the song was eventually released on the A Very Special Christmas compilation album in 1987, and later on the Unreleased &amp; Rare album on &quot;The Complete U2&quot; digital box set in 2004. \n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90f9792fdd3957703eada4fd95d1c0ab23928d4e","amp;dn":"U2+-+It%5C%27s+Christmas+%28Baby+Please+Come+Home%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90f9792fdd3957703eada4fd95d1c0ab23928d4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,249,121,47,221,57,87,112,62,173,164,253,149,209,192,171,35,146,141,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
