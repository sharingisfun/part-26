Part of his isolation began in childhood, a reaction to a brutal father and the loss of eight siblings, including his beloved brother Ernst.\n\nThe tensions created by the mix of Czech, Germanic, and Jewish cultures Mahler was raised in is one of the elements that makes his work so striking and powerful.\n\nIncredibly, Mahler was able to unite the diversity of his world and his often tortured emotional makeup into rich and original music. \n\n\n\n8 Lectures\n45 minutes / lecture\n\n1    Introduction and Childhood \n2    Mahler the Conductor \n3    Early Songs and Symphony No. 1 \n4    The Wunderhorn Symphonies \n5    Alma and Vienna \n6    Family Life and Symphony No. 5 \n7    Symphony No. 6, and Das Lied von der Erde \n8    Das Lied, Final Symphonies, and the End ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06655cdde68839437ea5a56944ed2897846720cd","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Great+Masters+-+Mahler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06655cdde68839437ea5a56944ed2897846720cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,101,92,221,230,136,57,67,126,165,165,105,68,237,40,151,132,103,32,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
