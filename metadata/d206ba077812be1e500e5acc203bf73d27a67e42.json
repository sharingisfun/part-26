This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nUntil this week in 1974, Janis Joplin held the record for having more chart hits after her death than before. With this countdown, another artist earns the same distinction.\n\nOne song sets a record just by being in the countdown. It is by the fifth seperate act to come from the same family.\n\nOne artist in this countdown has had over 130 hit records! Casey tells who.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What album has stayed on the album chart the longest?&quot;\n\nThere a group in the countdown who at one time couldn't get booked unless promoters were allowed to bill them announcing the name of their lead singer who wasn't with the group anymore!\n\n40:    Band On The Run Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul McCartney &amp; Wings\n39:    Billy, DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Be A Hero Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bo Donaldson &amp; The Heywoods\n38:    Rub It In Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Billy Ã¢â‚¬Å“CrashÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Craddock        \n37:    WorkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ At The Car Wash Blues Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jim Croce     \n36:    Hang On In There Baby Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Johnny Bristol     \n35:    Come Monday Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jimmy Buffett    \n34:    (YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re) Having My Baby Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul Anka\n33:    Hollywood Swinging Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kool &amp; The Gang\n32:    IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Leaving It All Up To You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Donny And Marie Osmond\n31:    You And Me Against The World Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Helen Reddy\n30:    Rock Me Gently Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Andy Kim\n29:    You WonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t See Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Anne Murray    \n28:    ShininÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ On Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Grand Funk\n27:    If You Love Me (Let Me Know) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Olivia Newton-John\n26:    Fish AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t BitinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lamont Dozier\n25:    Sure As IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Sitting Here Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Three Dog Night\n24:    This Heart Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gene Redding\n23:    Tell Me Something Good - Rufus\n22:    Machine Gun Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Commodores\n21:    If You Talk In Your Sleep Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elvis Presley\n20:    Taking Care Of Business Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bachman-Turner Overdrive\n19:    Keep On SmilinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wet Willie\n18:    Wildwood Weed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jim Stafford\n17:    Finally Got Myself Together (IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m A Changed Man) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Impressions\n16:    One Hell Of A Woman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mac Davis\n15:    Waterloo - Abba\n14:    The Night Chicago Died Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paper Lace\n13:    Radar Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Golden Earring\n12:    On And On Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\n11:    Sideshow - Blue Magic\n10:    Call On Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Chicago\n9:    Please Come To Boston Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dave Loggins\n8:    Rock The Boat Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Hues Corporation\n7:    The Air That I Breathe Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Hollies\n6:    Feel Like MakinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Roberta Flack\n5:    Rikki, DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Lose That Number Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Steely Dan\n4:    Rock Your Baby Ã¢â‚¬â€œ George McCrae\n3:    Rock And Roll Heaven Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Righteous Brothers\n2:    DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Let The Sun Go Down On Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elton John\n1:    AnnieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Song Ã¢â‚¬â€œ John Denver\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d206ba077812be1e500e5acc203bf73d27a67e42","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1974_July_27th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d206ba077812be1e500e5acc203bf73d27a67e42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,6,186,7,120,18,190,30,80,14,90,204,32,59,247,61,39,166,126,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
