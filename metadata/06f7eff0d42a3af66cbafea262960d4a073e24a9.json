Kothai Cocopardo (Ajmal) decides to come down to a village in Tamilnadu in search of his roots after his father Manohar (also Ajmal) tells him on his death bed about his past life.\n\nInto flashback mode and it is shown that Manohar was brought up in a village called Karuppampatti amid a sea of relatives. Things take a turn when he enrolls in a college in the city, forgets his parents and his lifestyle undergoes a change.\n\nHe decides to leave everyone and everything behind and decides to go and settle down in France. Without the knowledge of his relatives, he takes the property documents and pledges them and with the money in hand, leaves for France without even bothering to perform the last rites for his dead mother.\n\nReturning to the present one finds Kothai yearning to set things right and takes the help of his cousin Karuppu (Jegan). He stages a drama and hides his identity and manages to bring his relatives to the village.\n\n[/b][/CENTER] [/quote]\n\n[center][img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/05578177089945523863.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://imageshack.us/a/img405/4108/pleaseseedy.gif[/img][/CENTER]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06f7eff0d42a3af66cbafea262960d4a073e24a9","amp;dn":"Karuppampatti+%282013%29+Tamil+%7E+DVDSCR+%7E+1CD+%7E+XVID+%5B350+MB%5D%7E+MP3%7ED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06f7eff0d42a3af66cbafea262960d4a073e24a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,247,239,240,212,42,58,246,108,186,254,162,98,150,13,74,7,62,36,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
