Fischer's potent originals and first-rate arrangements bring out the best in his musicians, which include Warne Marsh and Conte Candoli (featured on &quot;Miles Behind&quot;), Bill Perkins on a work trumpeter Stewart Fischer specially composed for the baritone saxophonist (&quot;Calamus&quot;), and alto saxophonist Gary Foster featured with Marsh on Lennie Tristano's &quot;Lennie's Pennies.&quot; A well-conceived chart of Billy Strayhorn's &quot;Upper Manhattan Medical Group&quot; swings mightily. The leader even makes a rare appearance on alto sax in the brief &quot;In Memoriam&quot; dedicated to the assassinated Kennedy brothers.
