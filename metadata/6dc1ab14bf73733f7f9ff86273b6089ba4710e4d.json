Breaker!, Chuck Norris, star of the jokes from 2007 that your lamest uncle is just now finding out about and preparing to forward to you, stars as a trucker who is also a champion arm wrestler. It's like Over The Top only with slightly less confusion about the heroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last name.\n\nChuckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brother is making his first ever trucking delivery, and his cargo is several hundred frozen TV dinners. His routine haul goes awry when his truck is attacked by lonely men in search of cheap, barely edible food-like substances. Actually, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s captured by the citizens of a rogue town of drunken hicks led by the delightfully Kelsey Grammer-esque Judge Trimmings.\n\nChuck must go in search of his missing mustache, and also his brother. To rescue him, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to very slowly kick some butt, due to the lack of mobility afforded by his denim jacket/pants combo. Fortunately, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got an ace up his sleeve: all his trucker pals who are apparently willing to kill dozens of people and destroy an entire town based on one CB radio message from an anonymous source reporting that a guy who theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen arm wrestle once or twice is apparently in some sort of trouble.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tale full of moonshine, hillbillies and sweet airbrushed eagles on the sides of vans. Mike, Kevin and Bill 86 the tuna, get the six top seated and give the blue plate special wings (trucker slang) in one of Chuck NorrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ finest mustache-less films, Breaker! Breaker!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRiffTrax are comedy audio commentaries of Hollywood movies, television programs and films featuring Mystery Science Theater 3000 comedians Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett heckling (or riffing) films in the style of MST3K, a TV show in which Nelson was the head writer, and later the host. The RiffTrax are sold online and delivered by streaming video and download. The site was launched by Nelson and Legend Films, now renamed Legend3D, in 2006 and is based in San Diego. In 2012, Rifftrax was purchased from Legend3D by Mike, Kevin and Bill and the RiffTrax CEO David G. Martin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dc1ab14bf73733f7f9ff86273b6089ba4710e4d","amp;dn":"RiffTrax+-+Breaker%21+Breaker%21+%7BChuck+Norris%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dc1ab14bf73733f7f9ff86273b6089ba4710e4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,193,171,20,191,115,115,63,127,159,248,98,115,182,8,155,164,113,14,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
