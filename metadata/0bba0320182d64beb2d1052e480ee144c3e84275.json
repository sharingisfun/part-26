These two games managed to give Platformers and First-Person Puzzle Games a solid place in the video game world. But what if Nintendo teamed up with Valve and recreated the famous Mario game with Portal gun mechanics?\n\nA complete from scratch recreation of Super Mario Bros. with a focus on perfectly imitating the feel the 1985 classic gave us. Then give Mario a portal gun, add puzzle game mechanics from Portal and there you go. And if that wasn't crazy enough, play 4-player coop, with everyone having their own Portal gun!\n\n\nFeatures:\n--------\n\n- Complete recreation of SMB\n- Elements from Portal\n- Portal gun that shoots portals\n- 4-player simultaneous coop\n- Level Editor that was used to create the levels in the game\n- 33 different hats\n- Downloadable Mappacks\n- Game modifiers for extra fun\n\n\nJust install and play. The installer will place a shortcut at the desktop and an entry at the control panel to easily uninstall the game.\n\n\nUpdates and more info: http://stabyourself.net/mari0/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bba0320182d64beb2d1052e480ee144c3e84275","amp;dn":"Mari0+1.6+%28Super+Mario+Bros+with+Portal+gun%29+repack%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bba0320182d64beb2d1052e480ee144c3e84275","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,186,3,32,24,45,100,190,178,209,5,46,72,14,225,68,195,232,66,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
