This wide variety of subjects makes it difficult to cover the whole subject matter of chemical engineering in a single book. The present series is therefore planned as a number of books covering areas of chemical engineering which, although important, are not treated at any length in graduate and postgraduate standard texts. Additionally, the series will incorporate recent research material which has reached the stage where an overall survey is appropriate, and where sufficient information is available to merit publication in book form for the benefit of the profession as a whole. Inevitably, with a series such as this, constant revision is necessary if the value of the texts for both teaching and research purposes is to be maintained. I would be grateful to individuals for criticisms and for suggestions for future editions.\r\nR.
