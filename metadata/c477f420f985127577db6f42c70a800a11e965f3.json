This study offers the first comparative perspective on gorilla populations throughout their natural range, and covers all known subspecies. Discussing phylogeny, evolution, functional morphology, behavioral ecology and conservation biology, this multidisciplinary work will be essential reading for primatologists, anthropologists, animal behaviorists and evolutionary biologists.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 528 pages\n    * Publisher: Cambridge University Press (January 13, 2003)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0521792819\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0521792813","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c477f420f985127577db6f42c70a800a11e965f3","amp;dn":"Gorilla+Biology%3A+A+Multidisciplinary+Perspective+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c477f420f985127577db6f42c70a800a11e965f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,119,244,32,249,133,18,117,119,219,111,66,199,10,128,10,17,233,101,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
