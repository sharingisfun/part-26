It features caricatures of cockroaches as its characters, and pokes fun at a wide array of subjects with little pattern as to what will be lampooned.  The comics themselves rarely have a set punchline, often instead having a joke in each panel.\n\nThis torrent collects &quot;Bug Martini&quot; comics from the strip's debut in 2009 through the end of 2014.  The comics are compiled into a set of CBR files, one for each year.
