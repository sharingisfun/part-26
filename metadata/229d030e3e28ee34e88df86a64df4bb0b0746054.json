It is also a nation of many contrasts. The Brazilian flag, for example, contains the slogan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œordem e progresso,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which means ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œorder and progress.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ In reality, most Brazilians, who are highly individualistic, resent excessive order and are opposed to too many rules and regulations. They are also quite unhappy that more economic progress has not been made rapidly. Although the Brazilian national anthem refers to the nation as the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œland of the future,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ yet most Brazilians actually place a greater emphasis on the present than the years to come. Brazil is a country from which much can be learned.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:229d030e3e28ee34e88df86a64df4bb0b0746054","amp;dn":"Brazil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"229d030e3e28ee34e88df86a64df4bb0b0746054","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,157,3,14,62,40,238,52,232,141,248,106,100,223,75,176,176,116,96,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
