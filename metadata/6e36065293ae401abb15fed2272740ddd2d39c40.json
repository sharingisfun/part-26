All I have done is use batch rename and re tag software to drag the sound choice catalog into the 21st Century and get rid of the ridiculous backward placing artiste names and there nice habit of placing there useless catalog number (I mean WHO plays physical media during a Karaoke show these days???) right in the Artiste Tag space.\n\nNow no one has to remember the 'Disc Number'  HELLO it is 2010 people, just ask my Video DJ for the song you want to sing and they will find it before you have time to draw breath...  PHYSICAL MEDIA IS DEAD we play from computer hard drives, that is it and that is all.  No CD's to go missing, get scratched, skip and jump or worse still refuse to cue... That, just like Cassette and VHS Tapes is HISTORY... GOT IT SOUND CHOICE sigh...  some how I doubt it.  Like the MUSIC VIDEO industry's continued support for 4:3 Ratio over widescreen I think they have totally lost the plot over the years.   Nothing like this download to wake them up I would say.\n\nLace - I Want A Man [Karaoke] (3:44)\nLara Fabian - I Will Love Again [Karaoke] (3:51)\nLara Fabian - Love By Grace [Karaoke] (4:01)\nLas Ketchup - Ketchup Song [Karaoke] (3:38)\nLasgo - Something [Karaoke] (3:39)\nLaura Dawn - I Would [Karaoke] (3:45)\nLauryn Hill - Everything Is Everything [Karaoke] (4:02)\nLauryn Hill - Ex-Factor [Karaoke] (4:42)\nLen - Steal My Sunshine [Karaoke] (3:56)\nLenny Kravitz - Again [Karaoke] (3:49)\nLenny Kravitz - American Woman [Karaoke] (3:53)\nLenny Kravitz - Dig In [Karaoke] (3:34)\nLenny Kravitz - Fly Away [Karaoke] (3:36)\nLenny Kravitz - I Belong To You [Karaoke] (4:08)\nLenny Kravitz - Lady [Karaoke] (4:21)\nLenny Kravitz - Live (Radio Version) [Karaoke] (3:59)\nLenny Kravitz - Stillness Of Heart [Karaoke] (4:22)\nLenny Kravitz - Thinking Of You [Karaoke] (4:24)\nLess Than Jake - History Of A Boring Town [Karaoke] (3:18)\nLfo - Every Other Time [Karaoke] (4:16)\nLfo - Girl On Tv [Karaoke] (4:05)\nLfo - I Don't Wanna Kiss You Goodnight [Karaoke] (4:02)\nLfo - Summer Girls [Karaoke] (4:14)\nLifehouse - Hanging By A Moment [Karaoke] (3:27)\nLifehouse - Sick Cycle Carousel [Karaoke] (4:30)\nLifehouse - Spin [Karaoke] (4:13)\nLifehouse - You And Me [Karaoke] (3:03)\nLighthouse Family - High [Karaoke] (4:12)\nLil' Bow Wow - Bow Wow (That's My Name) [Karaoke] (3:20)\nLil' Kim &amp;
