ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how Rowan Areno sees her life now. Before: she was a normal sixteen-year-oldÃ¢â‚¬â€a little too sheltered by her police officer father and her mother. After: everything she once believed has been destroyed in the wake of a shattering tragedy, and every day is there to be survived.\n\nIf she had known, on that Friday in March when she cut school, that a random strangerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shocking crime would have traumatic consequences, she never would have left campus. If the crime video never went viral, maybe she could have saved her mother, grandmother Ã¢â‚¬â€ and herself Ã¢â‚¬â€ from the endless replay of heartache and grief.\n\nFinding a soul mate in Eli, a witness to the crime who is haunted by losses of his own, Rowan begins to see there is no simple, straightforward path to healing wounded hearts. Can she learn to trust, hope, and believe in happiness again?\n\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c0b054910da46f316b625aad8bb67526b80759f","amp;dn":"Me+Since+You+by+Laura+Wiess","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c0b054910da46f316b625aad8bb67526b80759f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,11,5,73,16,218,70,243,22,182,37,170,216,187,103,82,107,128,117,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
