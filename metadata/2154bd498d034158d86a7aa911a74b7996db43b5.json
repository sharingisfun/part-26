He is kidnapped. He escapes, narrowly. The only person he tells is his best friend, Conner. When they arrive in London as planned for summer break, a stranger hands Jack a pair of glasses. Through the lenses, he sees another world called Marbury.\n\nThere is war in Marbury. It is a desolate and murderous place where Jack is responsible for the survival of two younger boys. Conner is there, too. But heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trying to kill them.\n\nMeanwhile, Jack is falling in love with an English girl, and afraid heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s losing his mind.\n\nConner tells Jack itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to be okay.\n\nBut its not.\n\nAndrew Smith has written his most beautiful and personal novel yet, as he explores the nightmarish outer limits of what trauma can do to our bodies and our minds.\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2154bd498d034158d86a7aa911a74b7996db43b5","amp;dn":"The+Marbury+Lens+by+Andrew+Smith+%28The+Marbury+Lens+01%29+%28ePUB%2FMob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2154bd498d034158d86a7aa911a74b7996db43b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,84,189,73,141,3,65,88,216,106,122,169,17,167,75,121,150,219,67,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
