Train-spotters will enjoy the railway details.\nThis is highly recommended family viewing that Ã¢â‚¬â€œ like so many of those 50?s adventure tales - it is great fun !!!\nGreat actors, good script, fine views, bags of excitement, a villain in the party and moral messages. What more do we need from a movie?\n\nThundering through its action sequences like a runaway locomotive, North West Frontier finds little to say about British colonial rule in India. Just as well it throws up enough epic battle sequences and nail-biting thrills to make amends.\n\nFrom a smash opening to quietly confident fade, North West Frontier is basically the ageless chase yarn, transferred from the prairie to the sun-baked plains of India and done with a spectacular flourish.\n\nAn excellent adventure film which turns the Raj into an apposite backdrop for the British equivalent of a Western.Kenneth More is a British officer who must aid the escape of a Hindu prince from a city besieged by the Muslims. This he does by means of a decrepit steam train, with a handful of Western passengers on board, one of them an enemy agent. It's exciting stuff, with reams of incident, confident dialogue, and impeccable 'Scope photography by Geoffrey Unsworth.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.20gb\nDuration.... 02:10:08\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 304\nData Rate.... 1195kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 123kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:822292562e79541d63c7ea47c278d08cf2f5e750","amp;dn":"North+West+Frontier+1959+BrRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"822292562e79541d63c7ea47c278d08cf2f5e750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,34,146,86,46,121,84,29,99,199,234,71,194,120,208,140,242,245,231,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
