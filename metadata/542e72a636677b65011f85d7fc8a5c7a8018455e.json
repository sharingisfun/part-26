In a flashback to Chicago in the 1920s, Stefan comes face-to-face with a shocking chapter from his wild past. After Damon gets a tip on Stefan and Klaus' whereabouts from an unexpected source, he and Elena follow their trail. Back in Mystic Falls, Tyler is concerned about Caroline and turns to Sheriff Forbes (guest star Marguerite MacIntyre) for help. Chris Grismer directed the episode written by Caroline Dries.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:542e72a636677b65011f85d7fc8a5c7a8018455e","amp;dn":"The+Vampire+Diaries+Season+3+episode+3+The+End+of+The+Affair","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"542e72a636677b65011f85d7fc8a5c7a8018455e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,46,114,166,54,103,123,101,1,31,133,215,252,138,92,122,128,24,69,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
