In development for 3 years, this new version of Active Sky has a completely new depiction system to enable enhanced visuals, accuracy and smoothness never before possible.\n \nUsing new low-level weather control techniques, the new depiction system eliminates many problems faced in the past, including inaccurate cloud locations, inaccurate coverage, thin overcast and excessive coverage gaps, non-smooth cloud transitions, inaccurate winds, and required compromises in depiction settings.\n \nWith ASN, your skies will be accurate, smooth, visually stunning and uncompromised. No longer must you configure complicated settings to achieve accuracy in certain areas while compromising others. You can have it all, all the time.\n \nASN also introduces, for the first time ever in a weather engine: Complete cloud position awareness, synchronized cloud-based ambient weather effects and an integrated accurate radar simulation. Precipitation is accurately depicted in the proper locations within and below appropriate cloud structures. Entering or exiting a cloud brings an appropriate change in precipitation, visibility and turbulence. The exact position of clouds and precipitation cells are always synchronized between the simulator depiction and the radar display.\n \nThunderstorms have been given great attention, utilizing the new depiction system, ambient effects, radar and cloud position synchronization. Completely new microburst, updraft and downdraft, enhanced turbulence and wind-shear effects combine to make thunderstorms beautiful yet dangerous. Using the new radar system will be key to safe piloting in the vicinity of these storms.\n \nFull International Airmet/Sigmet simulation is now provided in real time weather mode, with airmet/sigmet areas shown visually on the map and/or gauge.  These areas are now also synthesized, influencing weather depiction appropriately.  If a Sigmet warns against severe turbulence, convective activity, or icing, you can expect to encounter this appropriately during your flight.\n \nNew voice weather briefings, a new intuitive user interface with resizable/undockable and multi-window support, redesigned high-resolution wake turbulence simulation and enhanced air effects are just a few of the other new features in ASN.\n \nASN will be available for FSX initially (planned December 9, 2013), with a P3Dv2 version planned shortly after.  An ASN license entitles users to use both FSX and/or P3Dv2 versions.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1ed103d78563a9be43e448518708b9b4d123a01","amp;dn":"ASNext_FSX.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1ed103d78563a9be43e448518708b9b4d123a01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,237,16,61,120,86,58,155,228,62,68,133,24,112,139,155,77,18,58,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
