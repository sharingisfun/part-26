The team was given its first comic, Batman and the Outsiders, which debuted in August 1983, created and originally written by Mike W. Barr and illustrated by Jim Aparo, and then later illustrated by Alan Davis.\n\nAfter Batman left the group in issue #32, the title was changed to Adventures of the Outsiders and lasted until #38. After that issue, the book started reprinting stories from The Outsiders (1986) until it was cancelled on issue #46.\n\nThe cast of the Outsiders was notable for having mostly new characters (Geo-Force, Katana, Halo, and Looker), two characters who refused membership in the Justice League (Black Lightning and Metamorpho) and a former Leaguer, Batman.\n\nThanks to the scanners and the original sources.\n\nPlease seed. Please enjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe2435290495ee3fe0feb06ddaa47b5319f2be1a","amp;dn":"Batman+And+The+Outsiders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe2435290495ee3fe0feb06ddaa47b5319f2be1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,36,53,41,4,149,238,63,224,254,176,109,218,164,123,83,25,242,190,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
