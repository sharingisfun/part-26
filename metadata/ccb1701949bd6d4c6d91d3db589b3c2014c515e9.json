Recorded live in\nJapan in 2008, the album consists of two tracks: &quot;Face Up&quot;, and &quot;Face Down&quot;,\nfor twice more than half an hour of quite intense musical explorations. The\nfirst track is a high energy work-out, the second starts with counter-rhythmic\npercussion, full of explosive power and creativity, Berthling joins on bass,\nfirst plucked, and when Sandell joins he moves to arco, while the pianist plays\nsome eery chords, gradually driving up the tempo and energy level for again a\ndense improvisation, that suddenly collapses for some minimalist interaction,\nwith all three musicians exploring the more uncommon aspects of their\ninstruments. In stark contrast to some of the other albums below, the album\ndemonstrates that technical mastery and musical vision make it possible to\nbring depth and emotional drive even with the most common of all jazz line-ups.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccb1701949bd6d4c6d91d3db589b3c2014c515e9","amp;dn":"Sten+Sandell+Trio+-+Face+Of+Tokyo+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccb1701949bd6d4c6d91d3db589b3c2014c515e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,177,112,25,73,189,109,76,109,145,211,219,88,155,60,32,20,197,21,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
