That dynamic, hard rock crunch is what made the title track into an international hit, but it also gives the album dimension Ã¢â‚¬â€ not only can Jett &amp; the Blackhearts tear up heavy glam rockers, but they also pull off the mock psychedelia of Tommy James &amp; the Shondells' &quot;Crimson and Clover&quot; with aplomb. On the whole, I Love Rock 'n Roll doesn't have as many strong songs as its predecessor, but the band's muscular, gritty sound makes the album just as good as Bad Reputation.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I Love Rock 'n Roll\n 02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (I'm Gonna) Run Away\n 03 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Love Is Pain\n 04 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Nag\n 05 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Crimson And Clover\n 06 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Victim Of Circumstance\n 07 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bits And Pieces\n 08 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Be Straight\n 09 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ You're Too Possessive\n 10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Little Drummer Boy\n 11 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Oh Woe Is Me\n 12 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Louie, Louie\n 13 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ You Don't Know What You've Got","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e5d73412ed51399adfbbdc58d92a105ef7b2d62","amp;dn":"Joan+Jett+%26amp%3B+The+Blackhearts+-+I+Love+Rock+%27n+Roll+%5B1981%40320K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e5d73412ed51399adfbbdc58d92a105ef7b2d62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,93,115,65,46,213,19,153,173,251,189,197,141,146,161,5,239,123,45,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
