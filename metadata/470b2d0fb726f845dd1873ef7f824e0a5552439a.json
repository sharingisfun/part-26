On Impulse! has only five tracks, but each tells the complex, glorious story of Rollins's talent, especially in the stretched-out solos where his knack for inventively, endlessly de- and re-constructing melodies is evident. &quot;On Green Dolphin Street,&quot; &quot;Everything Happens to Me,&quot; and &quot;Three Little Words&quot; are among the standouts on this collection.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 On Green Dolphin Street  7:05 \n2 Everything Happens to Me 11:10 \n3 Hold 'Em Joe 5:31 \n4 Blue Room  3:42 \n5 Three Little Words  6:55\n\nRecorded at Rudy Van Gelder Studio, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, on July 8, 1965\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nSonny Rollins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ tenor saxophone\nRay Bryant ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano\nWalter Booker ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nMickey Roker ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:470b2d0fb726f845dd1873ef7f824e0a5552439a","amp;dn":"Sonny+Rollins+++On+Impulse+%28jazz%7D%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"470b2d0fb726f845dd1873ef7f824e0a5552439a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,11,45,15,183,38,248,69,221,24,115,239,127,130,78,10,85,82,67,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
