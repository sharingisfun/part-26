Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\n\nGuest(s): Gavin McInnes\n\nEpisode 164 - Sick and drugged up Anthony tells us about his mess of a weekend, we watch and discuss Louis CK's monologue on SNL, see Gavin McInnes being &quot;outrageous&quot; on Hannity, and Gavin joins the show via Skype to explain his stance on the unambitious, fixing your cunt, being PC, hate facts, and then he shows us the hell hole his wife is forced to live in. Ant reads a new Greg Gutfeld article on body dysmorphic disorder and the unrealistic view the internet brings, we get a Missy update, Ant talks about dreamy-rape that backfired on him, and a few ball busting callers get through. We look at videos of The Edge, Kelsey Grammer, and Madonna eating shit, Stinky puts us on to an old dude falling off of a sports stage, Anthony talks about the base jumpers in Yosemite that died, the fear of falling, Mitt Romney and Evander Holyfield boxing for charity, Hillary Clinton's silence, and we hear about shitbag Al Sharpton's daughter's ludicrous ankle sprain lawsuit. We then go through the biker gang shooting news story, notice that some people are happy to see the police, go through Monday's mail, discuss stereotyping by surroundings, watch a Live Leak video of a gal being held in a chokehold, read a news story about a researcher kicked off a plane, and end the show talking about over-reporting, hacking, and finding out that Rat is an afterhours I.T. guy for MILFs.\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb0801a27ddde2d50f76b8995f28b1171397107a","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-05-18+What+Did+Gavin+Say+This+Time%3F+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb0801a27ddde2d50f76b8995f28b1171397107a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,8,1,162,125,221,226,213,15,118,184,153,95,40,177,23,19,151,16,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
