The show premiered on February 13, 2009 on the Fox network.\n\nEcho (Eliza Dushku) is a young woman who literally embodies the Marine Corps' slogan &quot;Be All You Can Be&quot;. She is one of a group of men and women who can be, literally, anyone or fulfill any role -- by getting imprinted with personality packages, including memories, skills, language-even muscle memory-for different assignments. When not imprinted with a personality package, Echo and the others are basically mind-wiped, with no memory of their work outside the house. The show revolves around the childlike Echo's burgeoning self-awareness, and her varying ability to recall who she was before, a problem that begins to seep into her various imprinted personalities and puts her in danger both in the field and in the closely monitored confines of the Dollhouse.\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollhouse_(TV_series)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollhouse_(TV_series)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is episode 2x07 of 'Dollhouse' TV series encoded for PSP and hardsubbed in English.
