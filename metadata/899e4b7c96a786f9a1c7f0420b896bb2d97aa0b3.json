It became the inspiration for the cult classic movie The Warriors.[1] Compared to the movie, the novel takes a closer look at the concepts of sexuality, reputation, family, and survival. Because the movie was produced in 1979, a full fourteen years after the book was printed, certain key traits were rewritten to reflect cultural evolution.\n\n---------------------------\n\nOfficial Movie Adaptation / COMIC\n\n2009 marks the 30th-Anniversary of Walter Hill's cult classic film, The Warriors, based on Sol Yurick's novel. 2009 also marks the year when the Dabel Brothers adapt the movie to comic book form for the first time ever! Dabel Brothers Productions are making the film-to-comic translation as close as possible, and capturing the spirit of the movie, while at the same time adding some effects that can only be added in comic book form - in effect celebrating pop culture with a cult classic. The Warriors Official Movie Adaptation is something that fans and non-fans alike are sure to dig!\n\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:899e4b7c96a786f9a1c7f0420b896bb2d97aa0b3","amp;dn":"The+Warriors+1979+Book+%281965%29+Sol+Yurick+%2BMovie+Adaptation+Comic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"899e4b7c96a786f9a1c7f0420b896bb2d97aa0b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,158,75,124,150,167,134,249,161,199,240,66,11,137,107,178,217,122,160,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
