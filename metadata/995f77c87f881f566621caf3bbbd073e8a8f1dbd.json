PAL/NTSC DVD version do creates annoying gray walls in botch modes. Just make sure to use scaling for internal resolution with GSdx (4x, for example) to avoid double image or ghosting effect (well, in fact it's a graphical bug caused by unsupported internal resolution) with NTSC edition and make and extrasharp image and HD gaming. And that's it!!\n\nSeed as much as you can, at least a ratio of 1!\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:995f77c87f881f566621caf3bbbd073e8a8f1dbd","amp;dn":"PS2+Ico+%28NTSC+only%2C+English%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"995f77c87f881f566621caf3bbbd073e8a8f1dbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,95,119,200,127,136,31,86,102,33,202,243,187,189,7,62,138,143,29,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
