While attending Wakefield College of Art he began to develop a proficiency on the guitar, often citing Duane Eddy as an early influence. In 1970 he recorded with several experimental psychedelic groups on the Holyground label, finally releasing his first solo album, Northern Dream, in 1971. John Peel of BBC's Radio One began to promote his music which led to the formation of Nelson's first major band, Be Bop Deluxe.\n\nIn 78 Nelson dissolved the Deluxe and spent one year as a post-punkster in Red Noise. In 1980 Nelson released his solo album, Do You Dream in Color, which started a prestigious solo career that continues to this day. His recorded musical output is enormous to say the least, due in part to a musical philosophy he adhered to for part of the 90s in which he would try to record and produce musical ideas as quickly as he could come up with them, often knocking out finished recorded songs in just two hours before moving to the next one. Every year in Yorkshire there is a special concert called Nelsonica during which Bill Nelson performs and sells recordings of the subsequent concert for his fans from all over the world.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Captain Future's Psychotronic Circus (Plastic Mix)\n02 - Sex And Drums And Saxophones\n03 - Blue Sky Seeks Red Guitar\n04 - Howlin' Wolf In Me\n05 - Dance Of The Mullard Valvemen\n06 - The Aerostatic Balloonist\n07 - The Indelicate Levitation Of Katie's Skirts\n08 - Full Colour Fontana\n09 - The Man Who Was Tomorrow\n10 - Sun Kings Suffer (As Time Goes By)\n11 - The Mount Fuji Ice-Cream Factory\n12 - Illuminated Sky With Pale Blue Lightning\n13 - Neil Young\n14 - Like A Woman Levitating\n15 - Captain Future's Psychotronic Circus (Crystal Mix)\n\n\n*2010 Discs Of Ancient Odeon / Sonoluxe / BN | DOAO CD 006\n\nAll titles composed, performed, recorded and produced by Bill Nelson.\n\n\n\n\nSome Bill Nelson Album's....\n\n\nBill Nelson - Signals From Realms Of Light (2011) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11770655/Bill_Nelson_-_Signals_From_Realms_Of_Light_%282011%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11770655/Bill_Nelson_-_Signals_From_Realms_Of_Light_%282011%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nBill Nelson - Return To Tomorrow (2012)[EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11788464/Bill_Nelson_-__Tomorrow_%282012%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11788464/Bill_Nelson_-__Tomorrow_%282012%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nBill Nelson - Fantasmatron (2011) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11786042/Bill_Nelson_-_Fantasmatron_%282011%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11786042/Bill_Nelson_-_Fantasmatron_%282011%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da3fad022cb4624a4bbed11a9f95f82d8497e0d5","amp;dn":"Bill+Nelson+-+Captain+Future%27s+Psychotronic+Circus+%282010%29+%5BEAC-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da3fad022cb4624a4bbed11a9f95f82d8497e0d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,63,173,2,44,180,98,74,75,190,209,26,159,149,248,45,132,151,224,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
