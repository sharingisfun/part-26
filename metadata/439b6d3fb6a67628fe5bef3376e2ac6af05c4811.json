Examples of topics addressed are: fast and accurate numerical algorithms, model-order reduction, grid computing, immersed-boundary methods, and specific computational methods for simulating a wide variety of challenging problems, problems such as: fluid-structure interaction, turbulent flames, bone-fracture healing, micro-electro-mechanical systems, failure of composite materials, storm surges, particulate flows, and so on. The main benefit offered to readers of the book is a well-balanced, up-to-date overview over the field of computational science and engineering, through in-depth articles by specialists from the separate disciplines","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:439b6d3fb6a67628fe5bef3376e2ac6af05c4811","amp;dn":"Advanced+Computational+Methods+in+Science+and+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"439b6d3fb6a67628fe5bef3376e2ac6af05c4811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,155,109,63,182,166,118,40,254,91,239,51,118,226,172,106,240,92,72,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
