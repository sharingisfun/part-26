A few months after truly excellent Trilogy For The Masses debut LP (from December 1968) they released another concept album for ABC Records - Time Changes. Influenced by the recent works of The Beatles, The Byrds and Love, this slightly more commercial and unjustly underrated record was a kind of musical based on one manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. The music itself was very diverse, ranged from dark, atmospheric and ambitious tracks full of hard rock guitar-organ interplay, to much lighter sounds usually coupled with lush sound of strings. This record (an early production by Bill Szymczyk) is specially recommended for those who like classic 60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s rock sound.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e91a552924050ea87a30235f9e1c6e87063b76f5","amp;dn":"Ford+Theatre+-+Time+Changes+%281969%2F2011%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e91a552924050ea87a30235f9e1c6e87063b76f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,26,85,41,36,5,14,168,122,48,35,95,158,28,110,135,6,59,118,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
