These googly-eyed little balls of fur giggle, squeak, and sneeze as you poke and push them across the grid. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re also explosive when they get together in a group of three or more. And thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only one way to make Chuzzels happy: pop ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“em. Just slide, prod, and nudge the Chuzzles with a touch of the finger to match three or more (up and down, across, or both), and send fur flying and eyeballs bouncing. Once you start popping Chuzzles you might not be able to stop.\n\nFeatures:\nColor-match Chuzzles for points\nBeware of Puzzle Locks\nPlay four game modes\nWin trophies\n\n\nChuzzle will not run on these devices:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sony Ericsson X8\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Motorola Droid (OS 2.2 only, OS 2.2.2 or higher will run fine)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Motorola Devour\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“LG Ally\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“HTC MyTouch 3G\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Samsung Transform\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sanyo Zio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a19b313c6be081d9ddc4f29124140c6d2db67e9b","amp;dn":"Chuzzle+v1.0+For+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a19b313c6be081d9ddc4f29124140c6d2db67e9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,155,49,60,107,224,129,217,221,196,242,145,36,20,12,109,45,182,126,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
