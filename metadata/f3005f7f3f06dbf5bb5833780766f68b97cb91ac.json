Largely self-written, it's much shaped by producer Gerry Diver (Knapp's husband), who mixes electro-lite touches with tinkling acoustics, and on Seagiver and Hidden Seam elaborate strings and charging drums, providing a brooding backdrop for Knapp's vocal gymnastics. The Shipping Song elaborates the maritime spell of Radio 4's shipping forecast, Two Ravens is a mournful look at Alzheimer's, while tradition shines brightly on Hunt the Hare, a larkish duet with Alasdair Roberts. A masterful creation.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3005f7f3f06dbf5bb5833780766f68b97cb91ac","amp;dn":"Lisa+Knapp+-+Hidden+Seam+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.FLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3005f7f3f06dbf5bb5833780766f68b97cb91ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,0,95,127,63,6,219,245,187,88,51,120,7,102,246,139,151,203,145,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
