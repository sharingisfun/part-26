Tof**k yourself- I want some meatâ€), Stephen Lynch will always consider himself â€œa musician trapped in the body of a comedian.â€ His unique blend of musical based comedy has earned him fiercely loyal fans around the world who live to experience his sold-out live shows, five best-selling CDs, his RIAA-certified Gold DVD and his 2 top-rated Comedy Central Specials. You may also recognize him from his Tony-nominated role starring in The Wedding Singer on Broadway.\r\n\r\nHello Kalamazoo is his first special in over 10 years and was recorded at the end of his Lion tour","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c09747c366798c8d74e9abf0a7d269b1153c239","amp;dn":"Hello+Kalamazoo+-+Stephen+Lynch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c09747c366798c8d74e9abf0a7d269b1153c239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,9,116,124,54,103,152,200,215,78,154,191,10,125,38,155,17,83,194,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
