The three women sing with a band led by Dr. John and the session features guest appearances by such luminaries as David &quot;Fathead&quot; Newman and Jimmie Vaughan. The music is straight out of the Texas school of roadhouse R&amp;B and blues boogie but it's delivered with a gritty, hearfelt edge, particularly on the part of the three vocalists. Dreams Come True may follow formula, but it's followed with style and affection, which makes it a very enjoyable listen. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fcad0476926e75f1f34ebd10a01ee3c55d15a23","amp;dn":"Angela+Strehli%2C+LouAnn+Barton%2C+MArcia+Ball+-+Dreams+Come+True","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fcad0476926e75f1f34ebd10a01ee3c55d15a23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,202,208,71,105,38,231,95,31,52,235,209,10,1,238,60,85,209,90,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
