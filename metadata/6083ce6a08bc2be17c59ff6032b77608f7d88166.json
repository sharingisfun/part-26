At a time when half the population was under 18, he argues that although they had to grow up quickly and take on adult responsibility early, the experience of childhood could also be richly rewarding. Focusing on the three pillars of medieval society - religion, war and work - Baxter reveals how children played a vital role in creating the medieval world. \n\nVideo Codec: x264 @ 3600Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nFramerate: 25FPS\nAudio: English AAC 2.0 @ 160 Kbps ABR 48KHz\nRun-Time: 58 mins\nSize: 1.54 GB\nSource: HDTV\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6083ce6a08bc2be17c59ff6032b77608f7d88166","amp;dn":"BBC+Too+Much+Too+Young+Children+of+the+Middle+Ages+2011+720p+HDT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6083ce6a08bc2be17c59ff6032b77608f7d88166","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,131,206,106,8,188,43,225,124,89,255,96,50,183,118,8,247,216,129,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
