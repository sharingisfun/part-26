As a leader or\nparticipant in several different groups he has had the chance to explore many of\nthe facets of improvised music. On this album with his group Arrive, with Jason\nAdasiewicz on vibraphone, Jason Roebke on bass and Tim Daisy on drums, they\nexplore the open ended intersection between free jazz and composed music that\nwas the hallmark of great musicians of the 1960Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s like Andrew Hill, Bobby\nHutcherson and Eric Dolphy. Ã¢â‚¬Å“CradleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ brings that Blue Note axis to the forefront\nwith the band rotating on a broad musial axis in their choppy melody and fluid\nimprovisation. Ã¢â‚¬Å“LostÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a special performance, a ballad that is yearning for\nrelease through a spacious interlude of mysterious sounding vibes. The pace\ngradually picks up to a strong climactic finish led by strong saxophone. The\nspare and open feel also pervades Ã¢â‚¬Å“FifteenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which has stuttering saxophone and\ndrums setting the stage for a spare, open and spacious performance. Ã¢â‚¬Å“FrostedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nslows things even further to a hushed conversation between vibes and brushes\nbefore SheltonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tight saxophone enters, giving the music a light and open\nfeel. The album is concluded with Ã¢â‚¬Å“GoldenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ where bass and vibes set a subtle\ngroove before the leader picks up the pace with strong saxophone driving the\nperformance to a powerful conclusion.\n\n--\n\nby Troy Collins &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=39510&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=39510&lt;/a&gt;\n\nby Mark Corroto &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=39506&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=39506&lt;/a&gt;\n\nby Paul Acquaro\n\nby Vern\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13ff52314f8e0961b30c3d65bce17032b008d97c","amp;dn":"Aram+Shelton%27s+Arrive+-+There+was...+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13ff52314f8e0961b30c3d65bce17032b008d97c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,255,82,49,79,142,9,97,179,12,61,101,188,225,112,50,176,8,217,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
