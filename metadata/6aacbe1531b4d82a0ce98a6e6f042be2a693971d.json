We create our own reality in response to our internalising and assimilating the external, thereby our conscious and unconscious worlds collide within their own spheres. We are conspirational by nature, we 'speak' and conspire with (in) ourselves, immersed in our individual secret intrigue, our own Cabal. CABAL is an aural representation of this fascinating and (at times) beautiful apsect of nature...our drifting between realities where we face surrender, acceptance, sadness, fear, pain and ecstacy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aacbe1531b4d82a0ce98a6e6f042be2a693971d","amp;dn":"Carter+Tutti+-+Cabal+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aacbe1531b4d82a0ce98a6e6f042be2a693971d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,172,190,21,49,180,216,42,12,233,138,110,111,4,43,226,166,147,151,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
