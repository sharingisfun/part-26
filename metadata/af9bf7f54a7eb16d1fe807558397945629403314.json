The main text (original English) has never been altered in any edition; however, the full dedication was removed following LaVey's divorce from his common law wife Diane. Introductions to the work have been added and replaced. Burton H Wolfe, a journalist who wrote The Devil's Avenger, wrote an introduction to the original edition and later softcover printings, while Michael Aquino contributed the introduction to the hardcover edition published by University Press.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Bible&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Bible&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_LaVey&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_LaVey&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af9bf7f54a7eb16d1fe807558397945629403314","amp;dn":"The+Satanic+Bible+-+PDF+-+velvetfog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af9bf7f54a7eb16d1fe807558397945629403314","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,155,247,245,74,126,177,109,31,232,7,85,131,151,148,86,41,64,51,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
