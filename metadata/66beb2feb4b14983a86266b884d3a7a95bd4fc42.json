In fact they hold a perfect mirror to our souls and unravel the secrets of our deeper selves. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœUpanishad GangaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is conceptualised by Swami Tejomayananda, head of Chinmaya Mission Worldwide. Written and directed by Chandraprakash Dwivedi and co-written by Farid Khan, with valuable inputs and assistance from acharyas of Chinmaya Mission.
