It improves process flexibility, product quality, speed to market and inherent safety, with a reduced environmental footprint.\r\n\r\nThis book represents a valuable resource for engineers working with leading-edge process technologies, and those involved research and development of chemical, process, environmental, pharmaceutical, and bioscience systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo other reference covers both the technology and application of PI, addressing fundamentals, industry applications, and including a development and implementation guide\r\nCovers hot and high growth topics, including emission prevention, sustainable design, and pinch analysis\r\nWorld-class authors: Colin Ramshaw pioneered PI at ICI and is widely credited as the father of the technology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f40a5661d1d693707b561906858e2fba4e4311f9","amp;dn":"Process+Intensification+-+Engineering+for+Efficiency%2C+Sustainabi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f40a5661d1d693707b561906858e2fba4e4311f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,10,86,97,209,214,147,112,123,86,25,6,133,142,47,186,78,67,17,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
