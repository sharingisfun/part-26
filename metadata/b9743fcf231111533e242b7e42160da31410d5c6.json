The video also links television portrayals to negative cultural attitudes and public policies that directly affect the lives of working class people.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9743fcf231111533e242b7e42160da31410d5c6","amp;dn":"Class+Dismissed+-+How+TV+frames+the+working+class","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9743fcf231111533e242b7e42160da31410d5c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,116,63,207,35,17,17,83,62,36,43,126,66,22,13,163,20,16,213,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
