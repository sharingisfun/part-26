So, I found a way to auto-fill the DOSBox commands so you just click a shortcut and it starts One Must Fall 2097 immediately through DOSBox; it's seamless. The auto-fill only works with one game but as long as you're only playing OMF on DOSBox it's all good.\n\nI saw people on youtube videos cruising around in hacked robots in tournaments that looked pretty cool. I dug into the hacked stuff and figured out how to make a good hacked version that is stable. After so many years (on and off) of playing the normal version of the game, the hacked version is a lot of fun because some of the new tournaments have much better competition with AI similar to the unranked challengers plus the upgrades are redlined past what they should be which is fun.\n\nComment if you like!\n\n-\n\nThe year is 2097. World Aeronautics and Robotics, cutely referred to as &quot;WAR&quot;, is the largest and most powerful corporation in the world; the de facto ruler of the planet. They specialize in the production of HARs; Human-Assisted Robots, gigantic space construction robots that are controlled by a brain-computer interface. \n\nIn order to test their machines and earn further publicity, the board sets up a robot fighting tournament with the Ganymede operations as the prize. It mostly serves to justify giant robots pummeling each other, but it's still not a common setting in video games.\n\nThe aspect that really makes the game stand out is the tournament mode, a single-player focused mode using a custom pilot. This actually follows the traditional single player mode chronologically. A few years after the Ganymede competition, HAR battles have become a popular sport, and your hero is just one of many competitors. In a way, this can actually be thought of as the game's sequel. It was originally intended to be included in an expansion, but it was ultimately included at the beta testers' behest.\n\nWinning battles earns money, which the player can use to upgrade the pilot's stats, the HAR's stats, or to trade in their current HAR for another. The score count also translates to money at the end of a match. The player can thus increase their winnings by doing combos, delivering numerous hits without being hit in return, or performing finishing moves. They can also lose money by taking heavy damage or losing a match, both of which will have them chewed out by their chief engineer. If the player runs out of money completely, they may have their upgrades sold off in their repair or be booted from the tournament entirely","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8d8680a1c496c237f0d97b51196b5bafcf9bd2a","amp;dn":"One+Must+Fall+2097+Hacked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8d8680a1c496c237f0d97b51196b5bafcf9bd2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,216,104,10,28,73,108,35,127,13,151,181,17,150,181,186,252,249,189,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
