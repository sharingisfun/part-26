You should start with their first LP, &quot;Crush&quot;, if you&amp;#039;re new to Astrobrite. Those who are already familiar with the band can rest assured - lots of shoegazing fun awaits here. Bootleg contains unreleased or at least very rare songs.\n\nnote: Most of the tracks were titled by me, as they were untitled, and I&amp;#039;ve tried to bring the song titles as close to the Astrobrite style as I could.\n\n\ntracklisting:\n1.
