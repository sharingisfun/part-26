We'll look at the mechanics of using Maya 2014 as a sketching tool for designing the animations. \n\nFunctions we'll address are the graph editor, key frames, in-betweens and breakdowns as well as basic functionality of animation layers. Animations we'll focus on include idle, run, jump, attack, hit-reaction, death, celebration and deselect-idle animations. By the end of this tutorial you will have a deeper understanding of how to animate an in-game biped character using Maya.\n\n\n\nTopics include:\n\n1.Introduction and project overview\n\n2.Posing the idle state\n\n3.Animating idle state\n\n4.Starting to animate the run cycle\n\n5.Continuing to animate the run cycle\n\n6.Finalizing the run cycle\n\n7.Posing the jump cycle\n\n8.Finalizing jump cycle\n\n9.Starting the attack animation\n\n10.Finalizing the punch\n\n11.Creating hit reaction animation\n\n12.Adding breakdowns for hit reaction\n\n13.Starting to animate the death animation\n\n14.Continuing the death animation\n\n15.Posing the celebration animation\n\n16.Finalizing the celebration\n\n17.Creating deselect idle\n\n18.Finalizing deselect idle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61480442e36136f1ea0391b16f504b9f346d137d","amp;dn":"%5BDigital+Tutors%5D+Animating+In-Game+Biped+Characters+in+Maya+Vide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61480442e36136f1ea0391b16f504b9f346d137d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,72,4,66,227,97,54,241,234,3,145,177,111,80,75,159,52,109,19,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
