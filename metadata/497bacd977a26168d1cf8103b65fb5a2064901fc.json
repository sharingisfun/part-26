SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no good to us dead.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ These words \nhaunt Jane MacGuire after a shocking attack shatters her \nworld in an instant. Was it a random kidnapping attemptÃ¢â‚¬â€œ\nor the countdown to something far more sinister? Who is \nafter herÃ¢â‚¬â€œand what do they want so badly theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll kill \nanyone in their way? ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what Jane is determined to \nfind out, without the help of the police, the FBI, or her \nadoptive parents, forensic sculptor Eve Duncan and her \nhusband, Joe Quinn, of the Atlanta PDÃ¢â‚¬â€œbecause whoever is \nafter her wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hesitate to hurt those she loves the most. \nNow Jane will go on the run with the only man who may be \nmore dangerous than those who are pursuing her. A smuggler, \na con man, and who knew what else, Mark Trevor had his own \nmysterious reasons for wanting to keep Jane safe and out \nof the hands of a killer obsessed with a two-thousand-year\nold mystery that could rock the modern-day world.\n\nOrphaned at an early age, Jane grew up the hard way, but \nshe was given a new life, a loving family, and a chance \nto pursue her interest in one of the greatest archaeological \nfinds ever unearthed. Now someone was trying to destroy that \nnew life before it could even get started. The past is \nreturning with the kind of vengeance that knows no mercy. \nThe countdown has already begun, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approaching zero \nfaster than anyone thinks.\n\n\n\nCountdown (Eve Duncan #6)  \nBy Iris Johansen\nLanguage: EN\nPages: EPUB 639","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:497bacd977a26168d1cf8103b65fb5a2064901fc","amp;dn":"Countdown+%28Eve+Duncan+%236%29++By+Iris+Johansen+EPUB+EN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"497bacd977a26168d1cf8103b65fb5a2064901fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,123,172,217,119,162,97,104,209,207,129,3,182,95,181,162,6,73,1,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
