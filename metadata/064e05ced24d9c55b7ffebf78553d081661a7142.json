Up to a point. Brundle thinks he has ironed out the last problem when he successfully transports a living creature, but when he attempts to teleport himself a fly enters one of the transmission booths, and Brundle finds he is a changed man. This Science-Gone-Mad film is the source of the quotable quote &quot;Be afraid. Be very afraid.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:064e05ced24d9c55b7ffebf78553d081661a7142","amp;dn":"The+Fly+%281986%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"064e05ced24d9c55b7ffebf78553d081661a7142","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,78,5,206,210,77,156,85,183,255,235,247,133,83,208,129,102,26,113,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
