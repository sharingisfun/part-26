This compilation was released after Korn left Sony BMG Records, so it's likely the band had no contributions to the track listing. Also, there is no new material on this album, and most of the tracks are available on other releases, thus sales of this compilation were disappointing.\n\nAs of May 31, 2006, it has sold nearly 52,000 total copies in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                               _Steffengd\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97a195dd2b85948dcfaaff94288876e6991e6a2a","amp;dn":"KoRn+-+Live+%26+Rare+%28320+kbps%29+++++By++++++_Steffengd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97a195dd2b85948dcfaaff94288876e6991e6a2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,161,149,221,43,133,148,141,207,170,255,148,40,136,118,230,153,30,106,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
