This book includes the basics of religion and principles of Islamic Monotheism. It shows the Straight Path of the True Religion (Islam). It covers what follows: Iman (Faith), its characteristics and what nullifies or demolishes it. Each statement is supported by clear-cut proofs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9975b1356c00df72773e701edf3b79ebf532366","amp;dn":"200+FAQ+on+Muslim+Belief","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9975b1356c00df72773e701edf3b79ebf532366","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,151,91,19,86,192,13,247,39,115,231,1,237,243,183,158,191,83,35,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
