I worked together with Orup who wrote the first single Sinner. This was also the first time that I worked together with Niclas Frisk and Andreas Matsson.\n\nPeter Cartiers and Alex Papaconstantinou produced the first half of the album. The second half was produced by Stefan Olsson and me.\n\nMy favorites on this album are the opening track Shes Like A Butterfly and Freeway.
