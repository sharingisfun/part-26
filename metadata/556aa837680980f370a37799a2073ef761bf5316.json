In 1929 the Copenhagen City Council established a Choir School for the boys, the present Sankt AnnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦ Gymnasium (St. Anne's Gymnasium).\n\nPrior to 1959, the Copenhagen Royal Chapel Choir was permanently connected with Christiansborg Slotskirke (The Chapel of Chistiansborg Castle). Since then the choir has been giving regular concerts every Friday evening in Copenhagen Cathedral, and the boys have also been singing at High Mass and Vespers in the Cathedral.\n\nWith a comprehensive repertoire ranging from commissioned works by the leading composers of our time to the earliest polyphony the choir has over the years gained a reputation for being one of the finest of its type and it has recieved several high distinctions. The choir has given concerts in all parts of the world and has taken part in radio and television productions both in Denmark and abroad.\n\nThis torrent contains the albums\n\nGiovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina - Palestrina\nJul\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦rets krans - Danske salmer\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦rets Krans Vol. 2 - Danske sange\n\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;ddaeaab8afb4b6ec9dbbbcaea9b0bcb4b1f3bbb0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:556aa837680980f370a37799a2073ef761bf5316","amp;dn":"K%C3%83%C2%B6benhavns+Drengekor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"556aa837680980f370a37799a2073ef761bf5316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,106,168,55,104,9,128,243,112,163,119,153,162,7,62,247,97,191,83,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
