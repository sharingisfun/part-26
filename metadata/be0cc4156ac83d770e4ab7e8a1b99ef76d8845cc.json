Food preparation and cookery involve many processes which are well described by the physical sciences. Understanding the chemistry and physics of cooking should lead to improvements in performance in the kitchen. For those of us who wish to know why certain recipes work and perhaps more importantly why others fail, appreciating the underlying physical processes will inevitably help in unravelling the mysteries of the &quot;art&quot; of good cooking","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be0cc4156ac83d770e4ab7e8a1b99ef76d8845cc","amp;dn":"The+Science+of+Cooking+-+RePrint+Edition+%282012%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be0cc4156ac83d770e4ab7e8a1b99ef76d8845cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,12,196,21,106,200,61,119,14,74,183,232,161,185,158,247,109,136,69,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
