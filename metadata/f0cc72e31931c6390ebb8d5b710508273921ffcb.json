Every beehive has a queen bee...and the Hive has a king, a monster alpha male. Before the day is done, the boys are out to fill their boat, land the King and take another step toward their own crown. Over in Pierre Part, Troy Landry's sons are out to make their own name. Last season, Jacob and his dad bagged a legendary beast known as Treebreaker. In the swamp, when one alpha male is removed, another takes his place. Jacob plots to track down the Son of Treebreaker...and step out from his own dad's shadow. Across the swamp, Junior Edwards' sons Willie and Randy are also on the hunt, working for their dad. To keep his boys focused, Junior's made a big decision: NO hook. Junior knows that it's easy to catch a bad case of &quot;treble hook fever,&quot; and spend all day looking for a target. Down on the Conway Bayou, Glenn and Mitchell are after a prehistoric fish known as alligator gar.\nTVPG V-L","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0cc72e31931c6390ebb8d5b710508273921ffcb","amp;dn":"Swamp+People+S03E06+HDTV.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0cc72e31931c6390ebb8d5b710508273921ffcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,204,114,227,25,49,198,57,14,187,141,91,113,5,8,39,57,33,255,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
