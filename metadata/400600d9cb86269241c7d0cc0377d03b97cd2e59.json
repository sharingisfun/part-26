To my surprise it even updated to 10.6.2 using Apple Software Updater (OS X 10.6.2 Combo Update). Apparently, what makes all this possible is EmpireEFI4AMD.iso, which I'd never heard of. \n\nMore information about Empire EFI can be found here :- \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://prasys.co.cc/2009/10/empire-efi/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://prasys.co.cc/2009/10/empire-efi/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEmpireEFI4AMD makes it possible to install OS X on a physical or virtual AMD machine using an unaltered off-the-shelf OS X retail disk!\n\nNote:- EmpireEFI4AMD.iso has to stay in the CD drive for all this to work. You'll have to add another CD drive if you want to mount another disk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:400600d9cb86269241c7d0cc0377d03b97cd2e59","amp;dn":"Empire+EFI+for+AMD+machines","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"400600d9cb86269241c7d0cc0377d03b97cd2e59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,6,0,217,203,134,38,146,65,199,208,204,3,119,208,59,151,205,46,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
