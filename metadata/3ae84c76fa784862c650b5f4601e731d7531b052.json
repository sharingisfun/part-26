Clapton's concert was not only one of the finest Unplugged episodes, but was also some of the finest music he had recorded in years. Instead of the slick productions that tainted his '80s albums, the music was straightforward and direct, alternating between his pop numbers and traditional blues songs. The result was some of the most genuine, heartfelt music the guitarist has ever committed to tape. And some of his most popular -- the album sold over seven million copies in the U.S. and won several Grammies. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Signe [03:14] \n 02.Before you accuse me [03:44] \n 03.Hey hey [03:17] \n 04.Tears in heaven [04:36] \n 05.Lonely stranger [05:27] \n 06.Nobody knows you when [03:49] \n you're down &amp; out \n 07.Layla [04:46] \n 08.Running on faith [06:30] \n 09.Walkin' blues [03:37] \n 10.Alberta [03:42] \n 11.San francisco bay blues [03:23] \n 12.Malted milk [03:37] \n 13.Old love [07:53] \n 14.Rollin' and tumblin' [04:12] \n ____ \n \n 61:47 min \n 93,2 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ae84c76fa784862c650b5f4601e731d7531b052","amp;dn":"Eric_Clapton-Unplugged-%28Retail%29-1992-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ae84c76fa784862c650b5f4601e731d7531b052","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,232,76,118,250,120,72,98,198,80,181,244,96,30,115,29,117,49,176,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
