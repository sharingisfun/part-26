The book presents the topic in a concise and simplified manner so that students can digest the message and gain a basic knowledge of the entire field of plant biochemistry, from photosynthesis (the synthesis of natural plant products) to all kinds of genetic engineering with its many commercial applications. Topics include cell structure and function, lipid and polysaccharide metabolism, nitrogen fixation, phloem transport, synthesis and function of isoprenoids, phenylpropanoids and other secondary metabolites, plant growth regulation and development. Heldt provides a comprehensive description of photosynthesis, primary and secondary metabolism, the function of phytohormones and molecular engineering. The text covers research findings until the end of 2003 and identifies areas of future research. There are extensive references to the most recent scientific literature.\n\nIllustrated with two-color diagrams and well designed metabolic schemes\nPlant metabolism presented in the context of the structure and function of the plant\nMany examples of commercial applications for the protection and quality improvement of harvest crops, plant breeding, and the production of raw materials for industrial use\nCoverage of the latest research findings\nReview\n\n&quot;Plant Biochemistry will be an invaluable resource for students, teachers and researchers looking for a clear, up to date presentation which covers the essentials without being overwhelmed by details. There are simple, easy to grasp illustrations throughout....I would highly recommend this book as a text in plant biochemistry, physiology and biotechnology courses. The book highlights examples on how an understanding of plant biochemistry is fundamental towards the applications of biotechnology, which are bringing about a revolution in agriculture.&quot; - Gerald Edwards, Washington State University\n\n&quot;This is a welcome addition to the sparsely populated topic of recent textbooks in plant biochemistry. It complements rather than unnecessarily duplicates the many fine general biochemistry volumes available...The contents are well organized and laid out with logical and informative section titles. The text is nicely illustrated and regularly gives a clear and easily understandable overview of complex subjects, as well as provides some additional detail...This book will be an excellent introduction and overview of plant biochemistry to anyone interested in the subject. It also provides a nice reference for students of pharmacy, nutrition, environmental sciences, and ecology, as well as general biology students. As such, it will be a good textbook for classes associated with these subjects.&quot;\n- David Hildebrand, Agronomy, University of Kentucky in QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY\n\n&quot;The book Plant Biochemistry and Molecular Biology by Professor Hans Heldt is an outstanding text. The material is elegantly presented, with attention to molecular structures, intracellular compartmentation, and regulatory mechanisms controlling metabolism. Difficult topics are presented with incredible clarity and with a style that reflects many decades of cutting-edge research and effective teaching by the author. I highly recommend this book for both students and researchers in the field of plant biochemistry.&quot; - Steve Huber, University of Illinois\n\n&quot;The third edition of Plant Biochemistry by Hans-Walter Heldt updates my favorite text on this topic. My students prefered the first edition of this book to more encyclopedic treatments by a wide margin. The book covers aspects of biochemistry that are essential to a broad understanding of plant function. The book is focused on clear explanations of the essential concepts rather than an encyclopedic approach. Simple diagrams make even complex topics clear. The typeface and layout of the new edition is improved, with important words in bold, making important topics stand out for easy comprehension. This book is invaluable as a text for any plant biochemistry course.&quot; - Thomas Sharkey, University of Wisconsin\n\n&quot;This 3rd edition of H.W. Heldt's Plant Biochemistry textbook is built around proven artwork from previous editions, with some intelligent additions. It adds substantial new text and more references than in the past that can guide the reader to in-depth studies, often with references from 2004, clearly this textbook is not outdated. This edition places much emphasis on concepts that are presented in lucid fashion, providing an insight into complex processes in a straightforward way. This is particularly obvious in those areas of plant biochemistry that have been the author's own field of research for several decades. This textbook is an excellent vehicle to make green biochemistry understandable to undergraduate students.&quot; - Hans Bohnert, University of Illinois\n\nBook Description\n\nA translation of the leading international Plant Biochemistry text, translated from the German 3rd edition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c15a0126fa102c401f9db22f3a01188870f04ed1","amp;dn":"Heldt_Plant+Biochemistry+3rd+ed%5Bbellatrix%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c15a0126fa102c401f9db22f3a01188870f04ed1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,90,1,38,250,16,44,64,31,157,178,47,58,1,24,136,112,240,78,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
