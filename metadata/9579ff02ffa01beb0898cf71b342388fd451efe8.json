Once a promising young artist, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now stuck on an island ruined by tourism, drinking too much and working as a waitress in a hotel. Her husband, a contractor, is in a coma after a suicide attempt, but that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop his clients from threatening Misty with lawsuits over a series of vile messages theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found on the walls of houses he remodeled.\n\nSuddenly, though, Misty finds her artistic talent returning as she begins a period of compulsive painting. Inspired but confused by this burst of creativity, she soon finds herself a pawn in a larger conspiracy that threatens to cost hundreds of lives. What unfolds is a dark, hilarious story from AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most inventive nihilist, and PalahniukÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most impressive work to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9579ff02ffa01beb0898cf71b342388fd451efe8","amp;dn":"Diary+-+Chuck+Palahniuk.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9579ff02ffa01beb0898cf71b342388fd451efe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,121,255,2,255,160,27,235,8,152,207,113,179,66,56,143,212,81,239,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
