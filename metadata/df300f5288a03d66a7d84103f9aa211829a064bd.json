They discuss the impact of WikiLeaks on world politics, the release of the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, and Cablegate - the largest trove of classified U.S. government records in history. &quot;From being inside the center of the storm, I have learned not just about the structure of government, not just about how power flows in many governments around the world that we've dealt with, but rather how history is shaped and distorted by the media,&quot; Assange said. Assange also talks about his new defense team, as well as U.S. Army Private Bradley Manning, the accused Army whistleblower who has been jailed for the past year. Assange is currently under house arrest in Norfolk, outside London, pending a July 12 appeals hearing on his pending extradition to Sweden for questioning in a sexual misconduct case. He has now spent six months under house arrest, despite not being charged with a crime in any country. Assange was wearing an ankle monitor under his boot and Saturday's event concluded shortly after 6 p.m. so he could return to his bail address by his curfew. The event was sponsored by the Frontline Club, founded in part to remember journalists killed on the front lines of war. Today we play highlights from part one of their discussion.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df300f5288a03d66a7d84103f9aa211829a064bd","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+05+jul+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df300f5288a03d66a7d84103f9aa211829a064bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,48,15,82,136,160,61,102,167,216,65,3,249,170,33,24,41,160,100,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
