This program allows running Backup Copies of SafeDisc (C-Dilla), Securom, Laserlock, CDCOPS, StarForce and Protect CD (and many others) protected games. Also included is a Virtual DVDROM drive (Generic DVD-ROM) enabling you to use your CD images as if they were already burned to CD! DAEMON Tools works under Windows9x/ME/NT/2000/XP with all types of CD/DVDROM drives (IDE/SCSI) and supports nearly any CD protection.\n\nDAEMON Tools supports the following image files:\n\n    * cue/bin\n    * iso\n    * ccd (CloneCD)\n    * bwt (Blindwrite)\n    * mds (Media Descriptor File)\n    * cdi (Discjuggler)\n    * nrg (Nero)\n    * pdi (Instant CD/DVD)\n    * b5t (BlindWrite 5) \n\nNotes:\n\n    * DAEMON Tools needs a 1:1 Copy to run!!\n    * DAEMON Tools is used to RUN GAMES, NOT TO BURN THEM!!! Means emulation must be active while you want to play a game, not while burning the copy (except for you want to use DAEMON Tools' &quot;fastdump&quot; feature on a safedisc protected CD).\n    * If you want to run a copy protected application from an image mounted to a Generic DVD-ROM enabling the copy protection emulation(s) is NOT necessary!!\n    * Generic DVD-ROM is able to run nearly every protected or unprotected CD image (Safedisc, Securom, Laserlock, Lockblocks etc.) like it was the original CD! Just do an image file using one of the supported burning programs and mount it with Daemon Manager! \n\nWARNING: THIS SOFTWARE CONTAINS AN OPTIONAL ADWARE TOOLBAR. I RECOMMEND THAT YOU DESELECT THIS OPTION DURING INSTALLATION!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48c6b74976441d22d762d63bf42bc01771f67e07","amp;dn":"Daemon+Tools+Lite+4.30.1+%28Freeware%29+%5BKRZR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48c6b74976441d22d762d63bf42bc01771f67e07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,198,183,73,118,68,29,34,215,98,214,59,244,43,192,23,113,246,126,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
