Hamacher et al. (Wiley-VCH, 2006).pdf\r\n\r\nFrom skillful handling of the wide range of technologies to successful applications in drug discoveryâ€”this handbook has all the information professional proteomics users need.\r\nEdited by experts working at one of the hot spots in European proteomic research, the numerous contributions by experts from the pharmaceutical industry and public proteomics consortia to provide the necessary perspective on current trends and developments in this exciting field.\r\n\r\nFollowing an introductory chapter, the book moves on to proteomic technologies, such as protein biochips, protein-protein interactions, and proteome analysis in situ. The section on applications includes bioinformatics, Alzheimer's disease, neuroproteomics, plasma and T-cell proteomics, differential phosphoproteome analysis and biomarkers, as well as pharmacogenomics.\r\n\r\nInvaluable reading for medicinal and pharmaceutical chemists, gene technologists, molecular biologists, and those working in the pharmaceutical industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d6f981367b7b674c979edbb8e9b42bd67eaac0e","amp;dn":"Proteomics+in+Drug+Research+-+M.+Hamacher+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d6f981367b7b674c979edbb8e9b42bd67eaac0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,111,152,19,103,183,182,116,201,121,237,187,142,155,66,189,103,234,172,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
