The first three limited series, reprinted in the collected editions Biohazards, Dangerous Acquaintances, and Plague of Angels, were published by the since-defunct Eclipse Comics. Later, the rights were transferred to Dark Horse Comics. The first three series were written by Toren Smith and Adam Warren and drawn by Warren Ã¢â‚¬â€ after that, Smith left the project and Warren took over writing completely. These stories have a much more cyberpunk style than the other versions; the later stories, starting with &quot;Fatal But Not Serious&quot;, move into the transhuman and posthuman subgenres.\n\n\nThis torrent has the first three volumes, all published by Eclipse, in both their original form and later, collected editions. May the Gods favor the creative teams! May the scanners gain favor in the afterlife! Acquire it, share it!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d87ce33393307a39e72b94e25098f5e20661611d","amp;dn":"Dirty+Pair+%28Eclipse%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d87ce33393307a39e72b94e25098f5e20661611d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,124,227,51,147,48,122,57,231,43,148,226,80,152,245,226,6,97,97,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
