He also takes a look at the latest moves by the gun-grabbers as the ATF builds a massive database to spy on law-abiding Americans practicing their right to own firearms. \n\nOn today's broadcast, Alex talks with renowned author and former Department of State official Steve Pieczenik. \n\nHe also welcomes former Secret Service agent and New York police officer Daniel Bongion, who is running for the Maryland Senate. \n\nAustin political activist Antonio Buehler appears in-studio today. Antonio was arrested in early 2012 for protesting against police abuse and again later in the year for &quot;cop watching&quot; in Austin, Texas.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
