A brawl breaks out between the townspeople and the crew from Matthildur. As a consequence Ingalo leaves home.\n\nIngalÃƒÂ³ is helping her father on his small fishing boat, but he's an obstinate character and relations between them are tense. After a dance in the village which ends in a fight between the local people and crew of Matthildur Ãƒï¿½S 167, a visiting fishing boat, IngalÃƒÂ³ and her younger brother leave home. IngalÃƒÂ³ stays briefly in ReykjavÃƒÂ­k and has a short affair with VilhjÃƒÂ¡lmur, a man in his thirties. Sveinn has found a job on Matthildur and IngalÃƒÂ³ is taken on as a cook. The fishing is poor and when the vessel breaks down it heads for home port, where the crew stays in derelict living quarters for seasonal workers. IngalÃƒÂ³ finds out that Matthildur's owner and big wheel in town is none other than VilhjÃƒÂ¡lmur. Already mocked by the crew for being unable to cope with life at sea, Sveinn suffers absolute humiliation at the living quarters. InaglÃƒÂ³ is torn between her protective instincts towards Sveinn and her attraction towards SkÃƒÂºli, the chief engineer on Matthildur. But SkÃƒÂºli himself has plenty of other things on his mind, among them the new local beauty queen.\n\n\nDVDRip XviD MP3 Avi - 624 x 336 - 93 min\n\n\nThe film is in Icelandic language with English, French, German and Icelandic subtitles.\n\n\nIf you like it: Buy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d50941955c7863b312b61ba4cb4b31824280e0b","amp;dn":"Ingal%26oacute%3B+%281992%29+%26Aacute%3Bsd%26iacute%3Bs+Thoroddsen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d50941955c7863b312b61ba4cb4b31824280e0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,80,148,25,85,199,134,59,49,43,97,186,76,180,179,24,36,40,14,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
