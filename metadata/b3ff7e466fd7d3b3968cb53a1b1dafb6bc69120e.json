The volume focuses on how basic linguistic knowledge can inform teachers' approaches to language issues in the multicultural, linguistically diverse classroom. The text also includes examples of practical applications of language awareness to pedagogy, assessment, and curriculum construction, which support the current goals of language arts, bilingual, and ESL education. Language in the Schools: Integrating Linguistics Knowledge into K-12 Teaching contributes to the resources on linguistics and education by taking prospective teachers beyond basic linguistics to ways in which linguistics can productively inform their teaching and raise their students' awareness of language. It is intended as a text for students in teacher education programs who have a basic knowledge of linguistics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3ff7e466fd7d3b3968cb53a1b1dafb6bc69120e","amp;dn":"Language+In+The+Schools","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3ff7e466fd7d3b3968cb53a1b1dafb6bc69120e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,255,126,70,111,215,211,179,150,140,181,58,27,29,175,182,188,105,18,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
