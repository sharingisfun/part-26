The young and headstrong D'Artagnan, having proven his bravery by dueling with each, becomes a friend of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, members of the King's Musketeers. He is in love with Constance Bonancieux and, at her urging, he and his friends head for England to reclaim two diamond studs that the Queen has imprudently given to her lover, the Duke of Buckingham. Richelieu, the chief minister of King Louis XIII, will resort to anything - even murder - to stop the Musketeers from interfering with his plan to ruin Queen Anne's reputation, and her influence over the King. The Three Musketeers is one of the world's greatest adventure stories, and its heroes have become symbols of youth, daring, and friendship. Behind the flashing blades, Dumas explores the eternal conflict between good and evil.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Three Musketeers (French: Les Trois Mousquetaires) is a novel by Alexandre Dumas, first serialized in MarchÃ¢â‚¬â€œJuly 1844. Set in the 17th century, it recounts the adventures of a young man named d'Artagnan after he leaves home to travel to Paris, to join the Musketeers of the Guard. D'Artagnan is not one of the musketeers of the title; those are his friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, inseparable friends who live by the motto &quot;all for one, one for all&quot; (&quot;tous pour un, un pour tous&quot;), a motto which is first put forth by d'Artagnan.\n\nThe story of d'Artagnan is continued in Twenty Years After and The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later. Those three novels by Dumas are together known as the d'Artagnan Romances.\n\nThe Three Musketeers was first published in serial form in the newspaper Le SiÃƒÂ¨cle between March and July 1844.\n\nWhen Alexandre Dumas wrote The Three Musketeers he also was a practising fencer and like many other French gentlemen of his generation he attended the schools for Canne de combat and Savate of Michel Casseux, Charles Lecour and Joseph Charlemont (who had been a regular fencing instructor in the French army).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6570eb343828da31938a6a324a8bc36c273d346","amp;dn":"Alexandre+Dumas+-+The+Three+Musketeers+%5B1998%5D+96kbps+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6570eb343828da31938a6a324a8bc36c273d346","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,87,14,179,67,130,141,163,25,56,166,163,36,168,188,54,194,115,211,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
