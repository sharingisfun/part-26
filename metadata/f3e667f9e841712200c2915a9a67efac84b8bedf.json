I&amp;#039;ve also included serial number, if you install all six, one serial number activates them all (or as many as you install).  Magic Frames has a seperate number, don&amp;#039;t mix them up.  Magic frames has approx 2,000 different frames.  \n\nHope you enjoy these as much as i do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3e667f9e841712200c2915a9a67efac84b8bedf","amp;dn":"Classic+Frames+%2B+Actions+%28with+serials%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3e667f9e841712200c2915a9a67efac84b8bedf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,230,103,249,232,65,113,34,0,194,145,90,154,103,239,172,132,184,190,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
