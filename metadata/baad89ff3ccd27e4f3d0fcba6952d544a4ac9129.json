Perhaps more than any other scientific area, evolutionary science has caused us all to question what we are, where we came from, and how we relate to the rest of the universe. &quot;Encyclopedia of Evolution&quot; contains more than 200 entries that span modern evolutionary science and the history of its development. This comprehensive volume clarifies many common misconceptions about evolution. For example, many people have grown up being told that the fossil record does not demonstrate an evolutionary pattern, and that there are many &quot;missing links.&quot; In fact, most of these &quot;missing links&quot; have been found, and their modern representatives are often still alive today. The biographical entries represent evolutionary scientists within the United States who have had and continue to have a major impact on the broad outline of evolutionary science. The biographies chosen reflect the viewpoints of scientists working within the United States. Five essays that explore interesting questions resulting from studies in evolutionary science are included as well. The appendix consists of a summary of Charles Darwin's &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;, which is widely considered to be the foundational work of evolutionary science and one of the most important books in human history.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nStanley Rice is a professor of biology at Southeastern Oklahoma State University. He is the author of several books about evolution and ecology. He has a YouTube channel (StanEvolve) for his videos in which he (as Charles Darwin) gives humorous examples of evolutionary concepts. He is a native of Oklahoma who grew up in California. He has degrees from the University of California and University of Illinois, and has worked in New York, Indiana, and Minnesota before moving to Oklahoma in 1998.
