Bigamy, unwanted pregnancy, possible incest and bothersome skin irritations are all part of their daily challenges, but the real &quot;star&quot; of the show is an enormous, dilapidated movie theater that doubles as family business and living space. At one time a prestige establishment, the theater now runs porn double bills and serves as a meeting ground for hustlers of every conceivable persuasion. The film captures the sordid, fetid atmosphere, interweaving various family subplots with the comings and goings of customers, thieves and even a runaway goat while enveloping the viewer in a maelstrom of sound, noise and continuous motion.\n\nSpeak in Tagalog (Filipin language) with subtitles in French.\n\nSUBTITLES IN ENGLISH: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/pt/subtitles/3608778/serbis-en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/pt/subtitles/3608778/serbis-en&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSUBTITLES IN SPANISH: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/pt/subtitles/3608781/serbis-es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/pt/subtitles/3608781/serbis-es&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSUBTITLES IN BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/pt/subtitles/3580676/serbis-pb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/pt/subtitles/3580676/serbis-pb&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThanks to those helping me seed.
