Visually sumptuous and dense - it&amp;#039;s a shame there has not been a region 1 DVD release of this.\n\nMusic composed and conducted by Michael Nyman, performed by the Michael Nyman band.  Sadly, Greenaway and Nyman had a falling out after this was finished; Nyman felt that the director had altered and subdued many of his musical passages throughout.\n\nCD is now out of print, though used copies can be obtained through second-hand vendors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fdc091058e754edabed9e721ca8a862b947eb42","amp;dn":"Prospero%5C%27s+Books+%281991%29+soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fdc091058e754edabed9e721ca8a862b947eb42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,220,9,16,88,231,84,237,171,237,158,114,28,168,168,98,185,71,235,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
