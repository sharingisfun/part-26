A world where real dangers are downplayed and nonexistent dangers are trumpeted. In short, a world where you are being lied to.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f272d24accf577f6d65bb288197da2b96e59bec","amp;dn":"You+Are+Still+Being+Lied+To+-+Russ+Kick+-+Disinformation+%282009%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f272d24accf577f6d65bb288197da2b96e59bec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,39,45,36,172,207,87,127,109,101,187,40,129,151,218,43,150,229,155,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
