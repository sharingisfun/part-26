This man was several centuries removed from the author of &quot;Shower The People&quot; or &quot;Your Smiling Face.&quot;\n\nPerhaps no other marital split between public figures was so well documented. &quot;Her Town, Too,&quot; the standout track on this decidedly uneven album, candidly captures the devastation of breaking up: &quot;Some of them his friends/Some of them her friends/Some of them understand&quot; To get the other side of this story, listen to Carly's devestating &quot;We're So Close&quot; (Available on her Spy CD!).\n\n&quot;Hour That Morning Comes&quot; masks its message of fear and adiction behind some southern soul music, but still gets its message across. And the desolation of &quot;That Lonesome Road&quot; is as much psychological as it is physical. To balance all this, Taylor does manage to throw in one positive sleeper, &quot;Summer's Here.&quot;\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Hard times                                           [03:13]\n02.Her town too                                         [04:35]\n03.Hour that the morning comes                          [02:57]\n04.I will follow                                        [04:18]\n05.Believe it or not                                    [03:52]\n06.Stand and fight                                      [03:11]\n07.Only for me                                          [04:55]\n08.Summer's here                                        [02:43]\n09.Sugar trade                                          [02:49]\n10.London town                                          [03:56]\n11.That lonesome road                                   [02:21]\n____\n\n38:50 min\n 48,4 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
