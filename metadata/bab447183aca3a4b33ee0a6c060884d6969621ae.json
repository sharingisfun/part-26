Passionate, tenacious, and occasionally brash, Haber, a former hockey player and park ranger, devoted his life to DenaliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wolves.\n\nHe weathered brutal temperatures in the wild to document the wolves and provided exceptional insights into wolf behavior. HaberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writings and photographs reveal an astonishing degree of cooperation between wolf family members as they hunt, raise pups, and play, social behaviors and traditions previously unknown. With the wolves at risk of being destroyed by hunting and trapping, his studies advocated for a balanced approach to wolf management. His fieldwork registered as one of the longest studies in wildlife science and had a lasting impact on wolf policies.\n\nHaberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s field notes, his extensive journals, and stories from friends all come together in Among Wolves to reveal much about both the wolves he studied and the researcher himself. Wolves continue to fascinate and polarize people, and HaberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work continues to resonate.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bab447183aca3a4b33ee0a6c060884d6969621ae","amp;dn":"Among+Wolves+-+Dr.+Gordon+Haber+and+Marybeth+Holleman.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bab447183aca3a4b33ee0a6c060884d6969621ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,180,71,24,58,202,58,75,51,238,10,108,6,8,132,214,150,150,33,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
