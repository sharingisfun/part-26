Although this show has been widely circulated as a bootleg, for the first time fans will hear this recording in its entirety with the never before heard Seek Up, a funky and audience-aided Recently, and the night's encore, Halloween, which features a â€œbest ofâ€ list like Carter drum solo. LeRoiâ€™s performance is stunning - especially his interplay with Dave on Lover Lay Down and his soaring highs on All Along the Watchtower. Other highlights include an on point version of the short-lived Get In Line and Carterâ€™s incredible pocket and backup vocals on The Song That Jane Likes. This Georgia Theatre show showcases a lot of character and Dave and Carterâ€™s vocals really compliment each other beautifully throughout.\r\n\r\n\r\nDave Matthews Band\r\nOctober 14, 1994\r\nGeorgia Theatre, Athens, GA\r\n\r\nTrackList:\r\n1.
