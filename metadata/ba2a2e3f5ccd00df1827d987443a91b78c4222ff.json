Alas you may do well to pick up a copy the Zalewskis&amp;#039; &quot;Enochian Chess of the Golden Dawn&quot; for further musings/instructions and so forth....\n\n-Ikipr\nwww.aleph9.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba2a2e3f5ccd00df1827d987443a91b78c4222ff","amp;dn":"Enochian+Chess+PC+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba2a2e3f5ccd00df1827d987443a91b78c4222ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,42,46,63,92,205,0,223,24,39,217,135,68,58,145,183,140,66,34,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
