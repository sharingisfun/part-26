The next story is a bizarre, almost wordless western tale called &quot;The Gunslinger&quot;, which is followed by several strange, shorter pieces. The entire comic is drawn in an uncluttered yet highly-detailed style, and each panel is charged with quiet, intense drama. This issue will blow your eyes out and compel you to look back over the lush, almost lurid drawings many times over. Amazing stuff that needs to be seen to be believed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d39a6423a894f5a8033da7fd67b3367f6a6296e8","amp;dn":"Eric+Haven%3A+Tales+To+Demolish+%28Sparkplug%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d39a6423a894f5a8033da7fd67b3367f6a6296e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,154,100,35,168,148,245,168,3,61,167,253,103,179,54,127,106,98,150,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
