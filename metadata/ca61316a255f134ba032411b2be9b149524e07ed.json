IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a total sucker for this record too. It moves the fist clenching and sing along-muscles of my stomach, and sparks something in my brain too.\n\nThese guys have been playing in all kinds of bands over the years (No Torso, Fence, Olafly, The Phantoms etc), and what they have here, it seems, are their experiences, knowledge and passion distilled into one dynamite of a record. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taking the music back to its originÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, says guitarist and singer Martin Brostigen, Ã¢â‚¬Å“a group of friends hanging out, making songs based on real life narratives, clinically free of fictional clichÃƒÂ©s. Rett frem Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rett hjem Ã¢â‚¬â€œ egne hjem.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ A testament to the fact that there are punk bands out there still capable of staying out of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“stale cartoonsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½-bin.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœEgne HjemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was recorded in Calmeyer Studio, and produced by West Bank Robbers.
