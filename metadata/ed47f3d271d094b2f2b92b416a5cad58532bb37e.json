Comparisons to The Walkmen aren&amp;#039;t far off the mark?both groups share an appreciation for vintage instruments and the mod/ska sounds of The Specials?but where Walkmen deals in ragged morning-afters, White Rabbits evokes the champagne-popping here-and-now with buoyant ragtime and lyrical nods to The Great Gatsby&amp;#039;s endless, hollow pursuit of fun?and all the self-loathing and damnation that comes with it. The opener &quot;Kid On My Shoulders&quot; charges out of the gate with its relentless piano chug and a spectral chorus of the damned backed by an arsenal of Latin shakers and dual-drums, while calypso rhythms crop up in the shuffling ska of &quot;Navy Wives&quot; and the album standout &quot;March Of The Camels,&quot; where a chorus of creepy children (is there any other kind?) lends the song a ghostly Danny Elfman vibe. Rarely has the Inferno sounded this inviting.&quot;\n\nVisit them at www.whiterabbitsmusic.com!
