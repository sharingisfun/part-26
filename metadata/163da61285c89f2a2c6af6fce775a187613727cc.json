Now sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s far too busy with her summer internship at the Gem and Mineral Museum to think about childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stories. Between avoiding her former best friend and high school baseball star, Luke Reed, and trying to hide her unrequited crush on her mentor at the museum, the real world is occupying all of her time.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Until she walked into one.\n\nIt turns out fairytales arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t all fun and games. A curse has turned her neat and orderly world upside down, and to break it, she bands together with a fellow intern and a recently awakened princess whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been asleep for 900 years. Can this trio of unlikely heroines put an end to an ominous enchantment, discover true love, and keep an ancient and evil magic from being unleashed on modern-day Los Angeles?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:163da61285c89f2a2c6af6fce775a187613727cc","amp;dn":"Melissa+Dela+Cruz+Winds+of+Salem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"163da61285c89f2a2c6af6fce775a187613727cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,61,166,18,133,200,159,42,44,106,246,252,231,117,161,135,97,55,39,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
