The primary criterion for considering papers is whether the studies provide major advances into answering the important questions relevant to naturally occurring cancers.\n\nAreas covered by Cancer Cell include, but are not limited to, molecular and cellular mechanisms of cancer, mechanisms for the sensitivity and the resistance to cancer therapies, and development of better cancer therapies. Cancer Cell particularly welcomes translational research.\n\nCancer Cell is also interested in publishing clinical investigations, in particular those that lead to establishing new paradigms in the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of cancers or that provide important insights into cancer biology beyond what has been revealed by preclinical studies.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d65950c29771e77f8e90209ced368bc8cbc581c","amp;dn":"Cancer+Cell+Magazine+Collection+2012-2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d65950c29771e77f8e90209ced368bc8cbc581c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,101,149,12,41,119,30,119,248,233,2,9,206,211,104,188,140,188,88,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
