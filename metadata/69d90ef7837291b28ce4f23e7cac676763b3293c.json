Bone and other musculoskeletal tissues naturally have a nanocomposite structure, therefore nanocomposites are ideally suited as a material for replacing and regenerating these natural tissues. In addition, biological properties such as biointegration and the ability to tailor and dope the materials make them highly desirable for musculoskeletal tissue regeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\nProvides a comprehensive discussion on the design and advancements made in the use of nanocomposites for musculoskeletal tissue regeneration\r\nPresents an In-depth coverage of material properties\r\nIncludes discussions on polymers, ceramics, and glass","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69d90ef7837291b28ce4f23e7cac676763b3293c","amp;dn":"Nanocomposites+for+Musculoskeletal+Tissue+Regeneration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69d90ef7837291b28ce4f23e7cac676763b3293c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,217,14,247,131,114,145,178,140,228,242,62,124,172,103,103,99,179,41,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
