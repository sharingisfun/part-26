Lim tells the fascinating story of the scrolls since their discovery and explains their cultural context through the archaeology and history of the Dead Sea region. He discusses the science behind their deciphering and dating, and does not omit the cast of characters, scandals, and controversies that have hastened the scrolls' rise to the status of cultural icons.\n\nBeginning with their discovery in the 1940s, through the political, legal, and scholary controversies that still persist today, public interest in the Dead Sea Scrolls has remained exceptionally high. This is an accessible and well-written mini-history that will appeal to anyone interested in the true history of these fascinating documents.\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b184da18f23ab711ca504df46f782d530d246813","amp;dn":"The+Dead+Sea+Scrolls%3A+A+Very+Short+Introduction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b184da18f23ab711ca504df46f782d530d246813","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,132,218,24,242,58,183,17,202,80,77,244,111,120,45,83,13,36,104,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
