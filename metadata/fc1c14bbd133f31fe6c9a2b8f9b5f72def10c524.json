Beethoven admired the ideals of the French Revolution, and Napoleon as their embodiment, but Beethoven was so disgusted when Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French that he erased Napoleon&amp;#039;s name from the title page. He did this with such force that he broke his pen and left a ragged hole in the paper. Some time before the work&amp;#039;s publication in 1806, Beethoven inscribed the title Sinfonia eroica, composta per festeggiare il sovvenire d&amp;#039;un grand&amp;#039;uomo (Heroic symphony, composed to celebrate the memory of a great man). This great man might have been an ideal, non-existent hero, but more likely, it was the spirit of heroism itself that interested Beethoven. However, it seems obvious that Beethoven was referring to the memory of Napoleon&amp;#039;s once-dignified nature.\n\nBeethoven wrote most of the symphony in late 1803 and completed it in early 1804. The symphony was premiered privately in summer 1804 in Count Lobkowitz&amp;#039;s castle Eisenberg. The first public performance was given in Vienna&amp;#039;s Theater an der Wien on April 7, 1805 with the composer conducting.\n\nWikipedia\n\n===============================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc1c14bbd133f31fe6c9a2b8f9b5f72def10c524","amp;dn":"Beethoven%2C+Symphony+No.+3%2C+Toscanini+%281939%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc1c14bbd133f31fe6c9a2b8f9b5f72def10c524","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,28,20,187,209,51,243,31,230,201,162,184,249,181,247,45,239,16,197,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
