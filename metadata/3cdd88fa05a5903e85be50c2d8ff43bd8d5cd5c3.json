Just keeping it alive!!!\n\nR.J. Decker, star tenant of the local trailer park and neophyte private eye is fishing for a killer. Thanks to a sportsman's scam that's anything but sportsmanlike, there's a body floating in Coon Bog, Florida -- and a lot that's rotten in the murky waters of big-stakes, large-mouth bass tournaments. Here Decker will team up with a half-blind, half-mad hermit with an appetite for road kill; dare to kiss his ex-wife while she's in bed with her new husband; and face deadly TV evangelists, dangerously seductive women, and a pistol-toting redneck with a pit bull on his arm. And here his own life becomes part of the stakes. For while the &quot;double whammy&quot; is the lure, first prize is for the most ingenious murder.\n\nKeep Seeding!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cdd88fa05a5903e85be50c2d8ff43bd8d5cd5c3","amp;dn":"Double+Whammy%3B+Carl+Hiaasen+%28Mobi%2C+Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cdd88fa05a5903e85be50c2d8ff43bd8d5cd5c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,221,136,250,5,165,144,62,133,190,80,194,216,255,67,189,141,92,213,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
