However, a series of random terrorist attacks perpetrated by cyborgs and humans alike threaten to throw Olympus into total chaos. As it turns out, these humans and machines have come under the influence of an unknown electronic signal that hacks into their nervous systems and they then become the unwilling servants of a malevolent computerized entity. Thrown into the action is the plucky female E.S.W.A.T. warrior Deunan Knute and her cyborg lover/partner Briareos as they investigate these bizarre occurrences with the other members of their unit. Things become complicated when a bioroid named Tereus, who resembles Briareous in his human form, joins their unit and threatens to come between their relationship. But these three must put aside their differences to face an even greater threat that promises world destruction in its wake. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1043842/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1043842/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c2f02977a842fc03d42013bedf63ed4c8a74ea8","amp;dn":"Appleseed.1.and.2.BluRay.480p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c2f02977a842fc03d42013bedf63ed4c8a74ea8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,47,2,151,122,132,47,192,61,66,1,59,237,246,62,212,200,167,78,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
