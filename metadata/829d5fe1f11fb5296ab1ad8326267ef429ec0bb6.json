The first track, &quot;To Know Him Is to Love Him,&quot; presents the only exception as it was released in 1958, featuring Spector as performer as well, as part of the group The Teddy Bears. Initially a vinyl album-sized package, the box contained a booklet with photographs, complete song lyrics, discographical information, and a reproduction of the essay on Spector by Tom Wolfe, &quot;The First Tycoon of Teen.&quot; The package also contained a small, round, red &quot;Back to Mono&quot; pin.\n\nBack to Mono surveys recordings featuring and immediately leading up to the Wall of Sound, Spector's famed production trademark. Starting with &quot;He's A Rebel&quot; on disc one, through &quot;I'll Never Need More Than This&quot; and including disc four, all of the musical arrangements are by Jack Nitzsche. The list of musicians contributing to the tracks number in the hundreds, but prominent among them are Hal Blaine, Sonny Bono, Red Callender, Glen Campbell, Al DeLory, Steve Douglas, Jim Gordon, Jim Horn, Carol Kaye, Barney Kessel, Larry Knechtel, Jay Migliori, Ray Pohlman, Don Randi, Lyle Ritz, Billy Strange, Tommy Tedesco, Bill Pitman, and Nino Tempo.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NNBvARGZL.Image._SY450_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NNBvARGZL.Image._SY450_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.
