The previous thirty-eight films had barely begun to scratch the surface of these fascinating characters, and so Star Trek is back to answer all your burning questions: WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ScottyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite brand of bacon? Why does no one seize the moment and slap the hell out of Chekov? Why does Uhura jam that huge piece of machined steel into her ear? Was SpockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mom younger than him, and which uncle taught him that nerve pinchy thing?\n\nA tour de force of shameless retconning, Star Trek nevertheless introduces a bold new sci-fi innovation: time travel! And black holes! And characters meeting themselves! And ice planets! And evil nemeses who vow revenge! And ship flybys! These are by themselves very compelling reasons to watch, but Star Trek gives you an even more compelling oneÃ¢â‚¬â€to learn UhuraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first name. Sure, you never knew she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a first name, it was never an issue for you, and you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even given it one millisecondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thought, but at last you get to find out! (ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nyota, by the way.)\n\nMike, Kevin and Bill self-consciously tug down their red Federation uniform tops and go boldly into Star Trek!\n\n*******************************************************************************\nAs always donate or purchase the MP3's fromto keep these coming...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d42b3b5ccaca403a2dfdafdd5e29704f53a3a37","amp;dn":"rifftrax_startrek2009.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d42b3b5ccaca403a2dfdafdd5e29704f53a3a37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,66,179,181,204,172,164,3,162,223,218,253,213,226,151,4,245,58,58,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
