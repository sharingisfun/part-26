A. Wells tells the story of Higher Criticism: the close study of the scriptures that reveals difficulties and discrepancies. Wells traces the disciplineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s German beginnings, exploring the problems in the New Testament that prompted scholars to revise traditional theories of the scripturesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ origins. Wells then traces the development and reception of these views from the 18th century to today. Drawing on current biblical scholarship, Wells explains how the Jesus of PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s epistles differs radically from later versions and addresses conservative ChristiansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ attempts to reconcile them. He carefully analyzes what the New Testament says about miracles, the Virgin Birth, the Nativity, JesusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ conflicting genealogies, the Resurrection, the post-Resurrection appearances, and the failed prophecies of imminent apocalypse. Wells persuasively profiles the New Testament as a fascinating but flawed collection of incompatible viewpoints, revealing Jesus as a shifting, ambiguous, legendary figure who reflected the evolving teachings of a fragmented, emotion-based cultic movement.\n\n384 pages\nPublisher: Open Court (July 7, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0812696565\nISBN-13: 978-0812696561","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13cb2164fc74dd8112ac76f120184112f830ceb3","amp;dn":"Cutting+Jesus+Down+to+Size+%282009%29+by+George+Albert+Wells","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13cb2164fc74dd8112ac76f120184112f830ceb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,203,33,100,252,116,221,129,18,172,118,241,32,24,65,18,248,48,206,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
