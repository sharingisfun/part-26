McLaren - A New Kind of Christian: A Tale of Two Friends on a Spiritual Journey (Jossey-Bass, 2001). 286 pages.\n\nHigh quality native pdf.\n\n\ndescription:\n\n\nA New Kind of Christian's conversation between a pastor and his daughter's high school science teacher reveals that wisdom for life's most pressing spiritual questions can come from the most unlikely sources. This stirring fable captures a new spirit of Christianity--where personal, daily interaction with God is more important than institutional church structures, where faith is more about a way of life than a system of belief, where being authentically good is more important than being doctrinally &quot;right,&quot; and where one's direction is more important than one's present location. Brian McLaren's delightful account offers a wise and wondrous approach for revitalizing Christian spiritual life and Christian congregations.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4850242de8628ef74d0d9548bf05ad73930fe6ba","amp;dn":"Brian+McLaren+-+A+New+Kind+of+Christian+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4850242de8628ef74d0d9548bf05ad73930fe6ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,80,36,45,232,98,142,247,77,13,149,72,191,5,173,115,147,15,230,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
