NÃ¸rstebÃ¸ played before with Strid and de Heney in\r\ndifferent formats but the three never played together before as a trio, but\r\nNÃ¸rstebÃ¸ tells that the feeling of having a common ground came fast. The trio\r\nplayed occasionally since that formative exam and reconvened in 2014 for a\r\nsix-date European tour.\r\n\r\nThe debut double-album of this trio confirms the vision of NÃ¸rstebÃ¸. It feature\r\ntwo whole concert sets from the 2014 tour, the first one from the last day in\r\nOslo and the second, recorded four days before, from Vienna. Each of these\r\nconcerts evolves in a different way, but on both concerts the trio moves\r\nconstantly in an immediate, organic flow that alternates between segments of\r\nbuilding tension and its release, with a fascinating sense of drama. The highly\r\ncreative, explorative language of these like-minded, adventurous improvisers,\r\ntheir determined search for new sonic possibilities, as well as the profound\r\ntrust and understanding how to push forward any idea at any given moment, is\r\nsimply fantastic.\r\n\r\nThe Oslo concert features five intense and urgent improvisations. The trio\r\nexcels in transforming instantly fragments of sound, even almost silent,\r\nmicrotonal ones, into a rich, nuanced mini-dramas. Still, the trio never\r\nattaches itself to any sonic event, just letting the energy flow while enabling\r\neach musician to follow his impulses. The Vienna concert present two extended\r\npieces, more reserved in their spirit, affected by the reverb on the room, with\r\nmore opportunities for lengthy solos by all three. The dynamics of these\r\nimprovisations stress the the total freedom that each musician has, and their\r\ndifferent approaches to interaction, suggesting contrasting colors and and even\r\nrebellion within the almost telepathic interplay, all with a subdued intensity\r\nand great sensitivity to detail. This set, like the one in Oslo concludes with\r\nan intense, energetic coda.\r\n\r\nRaymond Strid (dr), Nina de Heney (b), Henrik Munkeby NÃ¸rstebÃ¸ (trb.)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Ed Pinsent \nhttp://www.thesoundprojector.com/2015/12/13/jazz-advance/\r\n\r\nBy Leif Carlsson (se) \nhttp://www.lira.se/skivrecension/oslo-wien/\r\n\r\nBy Jan Granlie (no) \nhttp://salt-peanuts.eu/record/norstebo-strid-de-heney/\r\n\r\nBy Tor HammerÃ¸ (no) \nhttp://torhammero.blogg.no/1428308968_for_en_reise.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2dbc6c98e3316c9101784ebe4129ad91f514b24","amp;dn":"H.+M.+Norstebo%2C+Raymond+Strid%2C+Nina+de+Heney+-+Oslo+Wien+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2dbc6c98e3316c9101784ebe4129ad91f514b24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,219,198,201,142,51,22,201,16,23,132,235,228,18,154,217,31,81,75,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
