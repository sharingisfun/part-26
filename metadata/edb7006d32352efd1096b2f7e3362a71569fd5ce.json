Fireworks. Explosions. All inside my brain. The white world goes dark and I know what's about to happen.\n\n\nZara White suspects there's a freaky guy semi-stalking her. She's also obsessed with phobias. And it's true, she hasn't exactly been herself since her stepfather died. But exiling her to shivery Maine to live with her grandmother? That seems a bit extreme. The move is supposed to help her stay sane...but Zara's pretty sure her mom just can't deal with her right now.\n\nShe couldn't be more wrong. Turns out the semi-stalker is not a figment of Zara's overactive imagination. In fact, he's still following her, leaving behind an eerie trail of gold dust. There's something not right - not human - in this sleepy Maine town, and all signs point to Zara.\n\nIn this creepy, compelling breakout novel, Carrie Jones delivers romance, suspense, and a creature you never thought you'd have to fear.\n\n================\n\nFor more quality uploads, please visit my profile and my thread :\n            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/dovah12/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/dovah12/&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Dovah-Mixed-Collection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Dovah-Mixed-Collection&lt;/a&gt;\n\n================\n\nDovah\t\t\t\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edb7006d32352efd1096b2f7e3362a71569fd5ce","amp;dn":"Carrie+Jones%2C+Need+Complete+Series+epub+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edb7006d32352efd1096b2f7e3362a71569fd5ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,183,0,109,50,53,46,253,16,150,178,247,227,54,42,113,86,159,213,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
