After dividing the entire restaurant space in half, each group is given a limited time and budget to transform their space into their vision for a new restaurant. Then, the two restaurants open and compete, side-by-side, by serving real customers over a period of two nights. The concept that does best overall in customer reviews, critic reviews and profitability will be the one that unites the restaurant again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ef208b61889435776f6d410ded5cf86bbee5435","amp;dn":"Restaurant.Divided.S01E01.WS.DSR.x264-%5BNY2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ef208b61889435776f6d410ded5cf86bbee5435","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,242,8,182,24,137,67,87,118,246,212,16,222,213,207,134,187,238,84,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
