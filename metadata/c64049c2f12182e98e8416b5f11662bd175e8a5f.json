His efforts to meet General Motors Chairman Roger Smith and persuade him to visit Flint, Michigan, frame a film that uses humor to devastating effect. &amp;#039;Roger &amp; Me&amp;#039; champions people over profits and slyly lampoons corporate America as it shows how the Flint folks cope with economic setbacks. As &amp;#039;The Village Voice&amp;#039;s&amp;#039; J. Hoberman wrote, the result is &quot;gutsy, populist, outraged and outrageous.&quot;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c64049c2f12182e98e8416b5f11662bd175e8a5f","amp;dn":"Roger+%26+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c64049c2f12182e98e8416b5f11662bd175e8a5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,64,73,194,241,33,130,233,142,132,22,181,241,22,98,189,23,94,138,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
