In Sex Cells, Rene Almeling provides an inside look at how egg agencies and sperm banks do business. Although both men and women are usually drawn to donation for financial reasons, Almeling finds that clinics encourage sperm donors to think of the payments as remuneration for an easy &quot;job.&quot; Women receive more money but are urged to regard egg donation in feminine terms, as the ultimate &quot;gift&quot; from one woman to another. Sex Cells shows how the gendered framing of paid donation, as either a job or a gift, not only influences the structure of the market, but also profoundly affects the individuals whose genetic material is being purchased.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e95b6f434ef5b7ca5f127fbdee2a9f3fafb765a","amp;dn":"Sex+Cells%3A+The+Medical+Market+for+Eggs+and+Sperm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e95b6f434ef5b7ca5f127fbdee2a9f3fafb765a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,149,182,244,52,239,91,124,165,241,39,251,222,226,169,243,250,251,118,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
