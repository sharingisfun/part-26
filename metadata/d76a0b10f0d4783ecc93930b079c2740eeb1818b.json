Initially attempting to create acoustic music, he recruited trained opera vocalist Tarja Turunen, but soon added full metal-band instrumentation in the persons of guitarist Emppo Vuorinen, bassist Sami VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nskÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤, and drummer Jukka Nevalainen. The band's demos landed them a contract with the Finnish label Spinefarm, which released their debut album Angels Fall First in late 1997 (it appeared in the rest of Europe the following year). The follow-up, Oceanborn, appeared in late 1998 and made Nightwish a bonafide mainstream success in their homeland; the album reached the Finnish Top Five and spun off three Top Ten singles. The band toured Europe heavily, consolidating their success, and in 2000 recorded their third album Wishmaster. Not only did it top the Finnish charts, but it also became the group's first album to be released in the U.S. (by Century Media, which reissued their previous albums in 2001 as well).\n\n\nFormat: Mp3\nBitrate: 320 CBR\nContains: Album Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n01.Taikatalvi\n02.Storytime\n03.Ghost River\n04.Slow, Love, Slow\n05.I Want My Tears Back\n06.Scaretale\n07.Arabesque\n08.Turn Loose The Mermaids\n09.Rest Calm\n10.The Crow, The Owl And The Dove\n11.Last Ride Of The Day\n12.Song Of Myself\n13.Imaginaerum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d76a0b10f0d4783ecc93930b079c2740eeb1818b","amp;dn":"Nightwish+-+Imaginaerum+%5B2011%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d76a0b10f0d4783ecc93930b079c2740eeb1818b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,106,11,16,240,212,120,62,204,147,147,11,7,156,39,64,238,177,129,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
