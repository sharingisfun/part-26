The film stars Keith Larsen, Jim Davis, Rodolfo Acosta, John Miljan and Damian O'Flynn. \n\nKeith Larsen stars as the Apache Kid, an Indian scout. He is willing to cooperate with the US cavalry until his brother is killed by another Native American. The Apache Kid is permitted to seek revenge under tribal law, but white law does not recognize this ruling; as a result the Kid is branded a renegade. A fellow cavalry scout (Jim Davis) is ordered to stop the Kid, but decides instead to let him go and seek out justice in his own way. Supposedly based on fact, Apache Warrior was directed by Elmo Williams, who in 1952 was film editor for the landmark western High Noon.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.10gb\nDuration.... 01:13:42\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 720\nFrame Height.... 500\nData Rate.... 2011kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps....
