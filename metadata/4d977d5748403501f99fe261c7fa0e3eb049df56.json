The Farm Aid concerts have remained an annual event over the past 26 years, and as of 2012 the organization has raised over $39 million to promote a strong and resilient family farm system of agriculture.\nMellencamp was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008.\nBand members (classic lineup):  Kenny Aronoff on drums and percussion, Larry Crane and Mike Wanchic on guitars, Toby Myers on bass, John Cascella on keyboards and Lisa Germano on fiddle.\n[From Wikipedia]\n\n- LINKS\nHomepage: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.mellencamp.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.mellencamp.com/&lt;/a&gt;\nDiscography:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mellencamp_discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mellencamp_discography&lt;/a&gt;\n\n- AVAILABLE DISCOGRAPHY FOR THIS COMPILATION:\n1976_Chestnut Street Incident\n1977_The Kid Inside\n1978_A Biography\n1979_John Cougar\n1980_Nothin' Matters And What If It Did\n1982_American Fool\n1983_Uh Huh\n1985_Scarecrow\n1987_The Lonesome Jubilee\n1989_Big Daddy\n1991_Whenever We Wanted\n1993_Human Wheels\n1994_Dance Naked\n1996_Mr. Happy Go Lucky\n1998_John Mellencamp\n1999_Rough Harvest\n2001_Cuttin' Heads\n2003_Trouble No More\n2004_Words &amp; Music_Greatest Hits\n2007_Freedoms Road\n2008_Life Death Love And Freedom\n2010_No Better Than This\n\n- COVER IMAGES\nThe original cover art (for the single/LP or CD) is included in the Info Tag of the mp3 file\n\n- LYRICS\nLyrics are included in the torrent (PDF file)\n\n-ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nMany Thanks to all the beautiful web sites from which I &quot;leeched&quot; all the information, images and lyrics.
