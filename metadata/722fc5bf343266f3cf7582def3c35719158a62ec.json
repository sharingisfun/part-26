Known as one of the most creative members of Braniac, who focused on a noise-rock mixture of vintage synth sounds and alternately-tuned guitars, his solo projects took him in another direction. His debut solo album, Forget Everything, which was issued by Seethru Broadcasting in 1999, featured some of the genre-bending experimentation that marked his work with Braniac, but with a more melodic, acoustic sound.\n\n\nFonte: http://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-stuart-mill-mn0001620408\n\nScheda tecnica :\n\nGuitarist : John Stuart Mill\n\nCD : Forget Everything\n\nAnno : 1999\n\nGenere : Alternative / Indie Rock, Electronica\n\nPaese : USA\n\nSongs :\n\n01 A-check\n02 learn the proper languages before you go to bed\n03 eternal story\n04 organ donor '97\n05 refresh the anchor\n06 aimless feathers\n07 canteen of pearls\n08 now and forever\n09 don't forget to write\n10 anybodies\n11 whiskey jones\n12 paranoid fantasies\n13 desiree has tooth decay\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i196.photobucket.com/albums/aa19/maxneb/seedordie5wmwe5.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i196.photobucket.com/albums/aa19/maxneb/seedordie5wmwe5.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:722fc5bf343266f3cf7582def3c35719158a62ec","amp;dn":"John+Stuart+Mill+-+Forget+Everything+%281999%29+%5BEAC+FLAC%2CCUE%5D%5BA.C.U","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"722fc5bf343266f3cf7582def3c35719158a62ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,47,197,191,52,50,102,243,207,117,130,222,243,195,87,25,21,138,98,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
