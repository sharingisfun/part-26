His father and friends would sit around the house getting drunk, telling stories and strumming acoustic guitars. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d run down songs by Hank Williams, Tom T. Hall, Glenn Campbell and Woodie Guthrie to name but a few. The idealism of those Cannery Row experiences would come to define his outlook on the world.\n\n\nCouldnt find a decent Grayson torrent, so I took matters into my own hands. \n\nThis collection includes all of his albums so far. Properly tagged. Bitrate 192 kbs.\n\nI'll keep this one alive for a couple of days, then it\\'s up to you all. \n\nIf you enjoy the music, support Grayson Capps and buy his albums.\n\nCheers!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e76b20e4875536da7b57cefb2044c02f3d205a5","amp;dn":"Grayson+Capps+Discography+June+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e76b20e4875536da7b57cefb2044c02f3d205a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,118,178,14,72,117,83,109,167,181,124,239,178,4,76,2,243,210,5,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
