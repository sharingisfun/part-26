This is kind of publication that makes me lament the slow decline of minicomics. Sure, you could do this on the Internet, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be some group blog or mass Facebook meme and the simplicity of the original intent would be lost. That intent being, in this case, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s re-dialogue a bunch of old Peanuts strips to make them horrible and wrong, eh?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe mini is divided into three sections, one for each of the three contributors. The strips in the first section are one-off gags where the Peanuts characters talk about periods, anal sex, abortions, cross-dressing, and whatever other taboo subjects a jaded indie cartoonist who probably wears an old-timey hat can think of. As far as shock-humor treatments of beloved family comic strips go, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s well-done but doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t rise significantly above the standards of the genre.\n\nThe third section uses miscellaneous Peanuts strips to tell an extended story about Linus developing a gay crush on Charlie Brown. More ambitious, almost on par with Jesse HammÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s redubbing of Family Circus panels with Fight Club dialogue, but still lacking a certain je ne sais quoi. Good work finding a strip of Charlie Brown sitting at LinusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bedside in the dark to illustrate the seduction scene, though.\nThen thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the central section, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBilliards.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBilliardsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the reason to track this minicomic down. (Well, that and Lucy saying, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChrist, that John Holmes has a fuckinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ big dick!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) An actual odd storyline from Peanuts in which LinusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s family gets a pool table has been assembled into a longform comic and rewritten as if badly translated from Spanish, turning it into something akin to a Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel. If I could explain why this is funny, I would have the secret of comedy and would have better things to do than put pictures of comic books I own on the Internet. But I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t, so all I can say is that by the time the dialogue gets to the rolling and the blood and Child Services being called in, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very good.\nSometimes comics are for extraordinary visions, grand statements, wise observations, beautiful pictures. And sometimes theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re for being stupid. This is a very stupid comic. I hope there are still comics that do stupid as well as this. With that, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m off to bed until I get the last of the Comic-Con out of my bloodstream.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tcj.com/blog/the-strangest-pictures-i-have-seen-8/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tcj.com/blog/the-strangest-pictures-i-have-seen-8/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tcj.com/strips/joe-matt-reveals-the-secret-origins-of-the-you%E2%80%99re-short-bald-and-ugly-charlie-brown-parody/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tcj.com/strips/joe-matt-reveals-the-secret-origins-of-the-you%E2%80%99re-short-bald-and-ugly-charlie-brown-parody/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db76ac4c4f8d73c79c995d2e4a4c9b1028d2c399","amp;dn":"You%5C%27re+short+fat+bald+and+ugly+Charlie+Brown","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db76ac4c4f8d73c79c995d2e4a4c9b1028d2c399","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,118,172,76,79,141,115,199,156,153,93,46,74,76,155,16,40,210,195,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
