Jakobsen (Springer, 2008).pdf\n\nISBN: 978-3-540-25197-2\n\nThis book closes the gap between Chemical Reaction Engineering and Fluid Mechanics. It provides the basic theory for momentum, heat and mass transfer in reactive systems. Numerical methods for solving the resulting equations as well as the interplay between physical and numerical modes are discussed. The book is written using the standard terminology of this community. It is intended for researchers and engineers who want to develop their own codes, or who are interested in a deeper insight into commercial CFD codes in order to derive consistent extensions and to overcome &quot;black box&quot; practice. It can also serve as a textbook and reference book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4421a572757dbe0967d090bb774e6548b9aadde","amp;dn":"Chemical+Reactor+Modeling+-+Multiphase+Reactive+Flows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4421a572757dbe0967d090bb774e6548b9aadde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,66,26,87,39,87,219,224,150,125,9,11,183,116,230,84,139,154,173,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
