This made the band's show in Paris on April 7, 1975 a historic moment in their long career, marking Blackmore's final appearance with the band (until the band reformed in 1984). The set took in tracks from Burn, Stormbringer (the latter rarely heard on stage), and featured the band's Mk III line up for the last time ever. It also marked the last time Deep Purple ever played the songs &quot;The Gypsy&quot;, &quot;Lady Double Dealer&quot;, &quot;Mistreated&quot; and &quot;You Fool No One&quot; live, though Rainbow and Whitesnake have played &quot;Mistreated&quot; in concert.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1\n\n01 &quot;Burn&quot; (David Coverdale, Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord, Ian Paice) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:46 \n02 &quot;Stormbringer&quot; (Coverdale, Blackmore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:12 \n03 &quot;The Gypsy&quot; (Coverdale, Blackmore, Lord, Paice) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:11 \n04 &quot;Lady Double Dealer&quot; (Coverdale, Blackmore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35 \n05 &quot;Mistreated&quot; (Coverdale, Blackmore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 12:49 \n06 &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; (Ian Gillan, Blackmore, Roger Glover, Lord, Paice) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:10 \n07 &quot;You Fool No One&quot; (Coverdale, Blackmore, Lord, Paice) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 19:30 \n\nDisc 2\n\n01 &quot;Space Truckin'&quot; (Gillan, Blackmore, Glover, Lord, Paice) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 21:21 \n02 &quot;Going Down&quot; (Don Nix) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:19 \n03 &quot;Highway Star&quot; (Gillan, Blackmore, Glover, Lord, Paice) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:33 \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel\n\nDavid Coverdale ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead vocals \nRitchie Blackmore ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar \nGlenn Hughes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass, vocals \nJon Lord ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ organ, keyboards \nIan Paice ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:325273d5f7ccdc4b00e4692f89bd6c879ff9ee49","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+%5C%27Live+In+Paris+1975%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"325273d5f7ccdc4b00e4692f89bd6c879ff9ee49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,82,115,213,247,204,220,75,0,228,105,47,137,189,108,135,159,249,238,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
