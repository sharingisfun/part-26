Sorry but my software would only load 15 tracks.\n\n\nTime Changes Everything brings WilsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s contemporary voice and message to a timeless jazz project.  This critically-acclaimed studio album, with two new bonus tracks, brings classic melodies, lyrics and arrangements, reminiscent of the golden age of the Great American Songbook into the modern era with original jazz and big band music that sets standards all their own.  It features 14 original songs, including the bossa nova wine inspired single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDrink It Up,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that showcase her dexterity as both a singer and songwriter.  She delivers a sonically masterful collection of modern-day life and love-lessons that pull from diverse influences, ranging from Cole Porter to Laura Nyro.\n\n\n1\tThat\\\\\\'s What Lovers Do \n2\tBack In the Day \n3\tTime Changes Everything \n4\tFedora \n5\tSad Matters \n6\tOne Little Reason \n7\tMinestrone Soup \n8\tFor Just a Day \n9\tSentimental Sundays \n10\tSavin\\\\\\' My Love \n11\tIn Disguise \n12\tGonna Dance \n13\tWedding Bell Blues \n14\tWhen I Do \n15\tDrink It Up\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Time-Changes-Everything-Anna-Wilson/dp/B000OU2HBG/ref=sr_1_2?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305000825&amp;sr=1-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Time-Changes-Everything-Anna-Wilson/dp/B000OU2HBG/ref=sr_1_2?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305000825&amp;sr=1-2&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first cd rip and my first torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c9298aec2ce98044487f55936f9efc432cf8724","amp;dn":"Anna+Wilson++Time+Changes+Everything+-+Sultry+smooth+jazz+singer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c9298aec2ce98044487f55936f9efc432cf8724","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,146,152,174,194,206,152,4,68,135,245,89,54,249,239,196,50,207,135,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
