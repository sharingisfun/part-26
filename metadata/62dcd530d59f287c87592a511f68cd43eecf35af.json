I picked it up a number of years not knowing anything about the performer, but it was the only complete recording in the store at the time. I was impressed the first time I played it, but since then, my enthusuasm grows for it every time I hear it. Only later did I learn that in addition to being Antal Dorati's widow, that she has recorded all of Haydn's piano works and just a few other albums--I will surely be on the lookout for them. I only wish she had recorded more widely.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62dcd530d59f287c87592a511f68cd43eecf35af","amp;dn":"Mendelssohn+-+Songs+Without+Words+-+Ilse+von+Alpenheim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62dcd530d59f287c87592a511f68cd43eecf35af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,220,213,48,213,159,40,124,135,89,42,81,31,104,205,67,238,207,53,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
