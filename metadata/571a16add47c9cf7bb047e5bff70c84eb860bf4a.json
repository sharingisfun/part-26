Connors This chemical kinetics book blends physical theory, phenomenology and empiricism to provide a guide to the experimental practice and interpretation of reaction kinetics in solution. It is suitable for courses in chemical kinetics at the graduate and advanced undergraduate levels. This book will appeal to students in physical organic chemistry, physical inorganic chemistry, biophysical chemistry, biochemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and water chemistry\nÃ‚â€”all fields concerned with the rates of chemical reactions in the solution phase","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:571a16add47c9cf7bb047e5bff70c84eb860bf4a","amp;dn":"Chemical+Kinetics+-+The+Study+of+Reaction+Rates+in+Solution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"571a16add47c9cf7bb047e5bff70c84eb860bf4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,26,22,173,212,124,156,247,187,4,126,91,255,112,200,78,184,96,191,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
