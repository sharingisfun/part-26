Yet those messages are both current and biblical. In this book, six of those tract titles are reproduced, page by page. But what makes this book unique is what is added. The book contains interviews with Jack Chick and David Daniels, in which the reader will learn the facts behind the writing of these stories. There are facts and statistics that will absolutely astound the reader.\n\nHot Topics confronts these vital issues:\n-The real purpose of &quot;hate crime&quot; laws\n-They're gay - and they want your kids\n-The hidden truth about Allah\n-Pornography: a victimless crime?\n-Is D&amp;D a doorway to the occult?\n-Israel: friend or liability?\n\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDavid Daniels, B.A., M.Div., is trained in Bible, theology and linguistics. After twenty years of searching the Hebrew and Greek scriptures and studying the history of the Bible, he concluded that the King James Bible is God's preserved words in English. He is currently Research Consultant for Chick Publications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2349431ec75e5d2bddd662bb811ce69a0bdb8810","amp;dn":"pics+-+David+W.+Daniels%2C+Jack+T.+Chick","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2349431ec75e5d2bddd662bb811ce69a0bdb8810","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,73,67,30,199,94,93,43,221,214,98,187,129,28,230,154,11,219,136,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
