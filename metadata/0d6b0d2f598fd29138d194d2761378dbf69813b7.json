Although the only known picture of Bunch shows him holding a National brand tricone resonator guitar, his primary instrument was the piano. Wheatstraw was born William Bunch in Ripley, Tennessee but grew up in Cotton Plant, Arkansas, where his family relocated soon after his birth. Little is known of his early life, other than that he took up playing both the piano and guitar at a young age.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Tennessee Peaches Blues 3:03\n2.
