Cooking shows featured all gourmet creations and web sites displayed artfully photographed delights.\n\nThen something changed.\n\nPerhaps it was the desensitizing of web culture or perhaps it was a cry for help from the food-loving public. But by God - there came a day when fancy vegetable towers came crashing down and $50 mushrooms were no longer acceptable. Amason and Blakley wanted see the old stand-bys, the carnival foods of their childhoods, the sticky mess of a deep-fried candy bar, the indulgence of a greasy burger with all the fixins.\n\nIt was the birth of the nasty food web-trend.
