The B1 was designed for medium mixed traffic use but also had the requirement of being cheap to produce due to wartime and post-war economies. The B1s operated across the LNER network and more than 400 were built between 1942 and 1952. However, with the change in British Railways policies the Class was withdrawn in the 1960s, long before the end of its expected economic working life.\n\nThe Thompson B1 for Train Simulator is available in British Railway black livery with lion-and-wheel emblem. In game features include fully detailed and operational locomotive cab interior, spectacular Pennines scenery and the famous Woodhead Tunnel system.\n\nThe Woodhead Line Expansion Pack &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7871303/Train_Simulator_2013_-_Woodhead_Line&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7871303/Train_Simulator_2013_-_Woodhead_Line&lt;/a&gt;\n(is required to play the scenarios included with this add-on).\n\nScenarios\nFive scenarios for the Woodhead Line (also available on 1337x And The Pirate Bay).\n\nAn Introduction to the Thompson B1\nChristmas Relief Special\nHello Campers\nMarylebone Express\nSteam Freight Revival\nKey Features\nThompson B1 steam locomotive in British Railways black livery with lion-and-wheel emblem\nRealistic cab interior with working gauges and firebox doors\nBR (Crimson) Mk1 coaches\nQuick Drive compatible\n\nHow to Install:\n\nTrain Simulator 2012\nSet the selected files.
