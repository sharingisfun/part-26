There are some scarce ones here -- old favorites you cannot find anymore. I hope everyone finds something new to enjoy, and sees fit to seed as long as they can.\n\nThis torrent contains:\n\nSteve Roach - Arc of Passion, Artifacts (a personal fave), Core, Midnight Moon, Origins, and Soma (with Robert Rich) albums.\n\nTangerine Dream - Sorcerer OST.\n\nCipher - a one-off ambient album from Great Britain. Long out of print. Highly recommended.\n\nCross Currents - Richard Souther.\n\nDeep Breakfast - Ray Lynch. This is the first &amp;#039;New Age&amp;#039; CD I ever bought.\n\nPrivate City - John Surman.\n\nTubular Bells II - Mike Oldfield.\n\nErgo Proxy OST, Opus 1 &amp; 2. Moody music from a quirky, well-drawn anime series.\n\nThis torrent, like my last, is dedicated to /x/. Were it not for them I never would have discovered about half the music in here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21076db35eeb56a060d39eda20a66825c44eba5f","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Ambient+II+%28Steve+Roach%2C+Tangerine+Dream%2C+and+more%21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21076db35eeb56a060d39eda20a66825c44eba5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,7,109,179,94,235,86,160,96,211,158,218,32,166,104,37,196,78,186,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
