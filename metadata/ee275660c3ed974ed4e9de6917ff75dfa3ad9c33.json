A stranger will greet you by name and invite you inside. At first, you won't want to leave. Later, you'll find that you can't. Every nine years, the house's residents - an odd brother and sister - extend a unique invitation to someone who's different or lonely: a precocious teenager, a recently divorced policeman, a shy college student. But what really goes on inside Slade House? For those who find out, it's already too late....\r\nSpanning five decades, from the last days of the 1970s to the present, leaping genres, and barreling toward an astonishing conclusion, this intricately woven novel will pull you into a reality-warping new vision of the haunted house story - as only David Mitchell could imagine it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee275660c3ed974ed4e9de6917ff75dfa3ad9c33","amp;dn":"Slade+House+audiobook+by+David+Mitchell+EarReaders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee275660c3ed974ed4e9de6917ff75dfa3ad9c33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,39,86,96,195,237,151,78,212,233,222,105,23,255,117,223,163,173,156,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
