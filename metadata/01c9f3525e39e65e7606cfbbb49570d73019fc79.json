A few months later he was replaced with Eric Clapton and after that a certain Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page also joined that volatile crew. When you consider what a staggering influence Cream, Beck and Led Zeppelin have had on everything in rock then and now - it\\'s a damn shame that Top Topham got musically lost in the mix somehow and has never been given the catalyst credit he so deserves\n\nTracklist: \n1.
