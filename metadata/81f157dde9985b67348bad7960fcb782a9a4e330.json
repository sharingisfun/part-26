The health implications, government \npolicies and push towards globalization are all part of the reason why many \npeople are alarmed by the introduction of genetically altered crops into our \nfood supply.\n\nShot on location in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, THE FUTURE OF FOOD examines \nthe complex web of market and political forces that are changing what we eat as \nhuge multinational corporations seek to control the world's food system. The film \nalso explores alternatives to large-scale industrial agriculture, placing organic \nand sustainable agriculture as real solutions to the farm crisis today. \n\nHomepage ............ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thefutureoffood.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thefutureoffood.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMDB ................ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0427276/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0427276/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMore related uploads: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81f157dde9985b67348bad7960fcb782a9a4e330","amp;dn":"Future.Of.Food.2004.NTSC.DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81f157dde9985b67348bad7960fcb782a9a4e330","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,241,87,221,233,152,91,103,52,139,173,121,96,252,183,130,169,164,227,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
