DNA. The Large Hadron Collider. Ever had that sneaking feeling that you are missing out on some truly spectacular science? You do? Well fear not, for help is at hand. Ben Miller was working on his Physics PhD at Cambridge when he accidentally became a comedian. But first love runs deep, and he has returned to his roots to share with you all his favourite bits of science. This is the stuff that you really need to know, not only because it matters, but because it will quite simply amaze and delight you. 'Let me show you another, perhaps less familiar side of Science; her beauty, her seductiveness and her passion. And let's do it quickly, while Maths isn't looking'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24787b52cc2048dd961ce3b5b8060522e652fe81","amp;dn":"Ben+Miller+-+Its+Not+Rocket+Science+%28Mobi+%2B+Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24787b52cc2048dd961ce3b5b8060522e652fe81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,120,123,82,204,32,72,221,150,28,227,181,184,6,5,34,230,82,254,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
