Uncanny tempests of incredible\npower sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped\necology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in\nbranches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built\nonly where the topography offers shelter.\n\nIt has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known\nas the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain:\nmystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into\nnear-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were\nfought for them, and won by them. One such war rages on a ruined landscape\ncalled the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical\napprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced\nto slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately\nagainst a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the\nleaders who consider them expendable.\n\nBrightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his\nbrother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The\nWay of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and\nthe Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.\n\nAcross the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train\nunder an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, DalinarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s niece, Jasnah.\nThough she genuinely loves learning, ShallanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s motives are less than\npure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at\nsecrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d775528fa2810b635b71f90d9a20ecde3d43aa8a","amp;dn":"The+Way+of+Kings+%28Stormlight+Archive+book+01%29+by+Brandon+Sanders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d775528fa2810b635b71f90d9a20ecde3d43aa8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,117,82,143,162,129,11,99,91,113,249,13,154,32,236,222,61,67,170,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
