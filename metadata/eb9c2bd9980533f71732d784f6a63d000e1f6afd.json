Led by the eldest sibling, 14-year old Lore (striking newcomer Saskia Rosendahl), they set out on a harrowing journey across a devastated country to reach their grandmother in the north. After meeting the charismatic Thomas, a mysterious young refugee, Lore soon finds her world shattered by feelings of both hatred and desire as she must learn to trust the one person she has always been taught to hate in order to survive. Lush cinematography and an evocative, haunting mood infuse this unconventional take on the Holocaust legacy with unforgettable impact. \n\n\nLanguages: German / English\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Swedish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb9c2bd9980533f71732d784f6a63d000e1f6afd","amp;dn":"Lore+2012+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb9c2bd9980533f71732d784f6a63d000e1f6afd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,156,43,217,152,5,51,247,23,50,215,132,246,166,61,0,14,31,106,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
