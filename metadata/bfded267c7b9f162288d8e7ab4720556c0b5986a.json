Phil Campbell claims the DUI was a set up and that Bubba's side wound up with his briefcase.\n\nThe whole thing is unbelievable.\n\nThe Burke show has the Mistrial hearing from Fri afternoon.  It is a must listen to show.  Testimony starts around 22 min and lasts a little while with Burke providing commentary.  \n\nThe mistrial clip has the lawyers summary of the motion for a mistrial.  It is off Fox 13 TB and lasts about 15 minutes.\n\nIf you have the time, listen to Burke.\n\n\nTrial resumes tomorrow.  Defense will call Hurricane, Kevin Haslett and others.\n\n\n\nJust because it says &quot;no seeds,&quot; doesn't mean there aren't any.\n\nMy max upload is 50K/sec. Sorry. It's all I've got. Slow torrent is better than no torrent. Please seed. \n\nI can only seed each upload for a day or or two.  I have too many competing priorities.  Please keep seeding.\n\nBubba.the.Love.Sponge, Bubba, BTLS, Bubba.Army, RadioIO\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfded267c7b9f162288d8e7ab4720556c0b5986a","amp;dn":"BTLS+Trial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfded267c7b9f162288d8e7ab4720556c0b5986a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,222,210,103,199,185,241,98,40,141,142,122,180,114,5,86,192,181,152,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
