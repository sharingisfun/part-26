One day the world might emerge as an empire of corpses, lifeless beings hailing for another death, decimation and extermination, a lifetime of reality shows. Since 2001, the Greek Thrash Metal non conformists SUICIDAL ANGELS have been trying to unveil the truth that is beneath the concrete, share the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inner pains in the utmost piercing methods at their disposal. Maintaining to gather their strength by following the giant foothold of SLAYER and early SEPULTURA and late 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s KREATOR with a few similarities to HAVOK, BONDED BY BLOOD and nowadays MUNICIPAL WASTE, leaving out the barfing the hardcoric salvos, the Greek incursion continued with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Divide And ConquerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, via NoiseArt Records. In overall, SUICIDAL ANGELS made sure that their Thrash signature wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be dismayed, kept on the offensive, but eventually turning up the same as before but with different numbers.\n\nLaying down the law all the way, relentless and committed to Thrash at command, the old school affirmation is the key to a slaughtering victory. More or less this is what I came to conjure out of SUICIDAL ANGELSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ musical doctrine. Admittedly, it sounds quite similar because all that these guys had to do was to recapture the same aspects that made them what they are. As a strong Thrash fan, SUICIDAL ANGELS, throughout the years, have been able to retain my faith in this Metal direction along with other bands. Their largely SLAYERish vision, especially the AmericansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ late 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s and early 90Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s albums, through their minds is a scorcher. Sure that it has its blemishes and in a way lack of uniqueness and it can be evident on the straightforward insanity of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Divide And ConquerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well, however, SUICIDAL ANGELS has a burning fire within them that unleashed a harsh dose of bloody chaos that its turmoil is rather attractive.\n\nThe heavy blaster Ã¢â‚¬Å“In The GraveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ attaining a classic thrashing mid tempo destroyer, shows simplicity that is shattering. The ultimate killing machine driven Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pit of SnakesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reminded me of a mixture of Ã¢â‚¬Å“War EnsambleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“BetrayerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, modest chorus with a rough attitude, comprising of classy riffs, several resulting in semi Punkish associations only to reveal a SLAYERism on the lead guitars. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seed Of EvilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is yet another great Thrash output, nonetheless, with its crushing mid tempo palm muted atomic devastation that insinuated of a pure old school fever and no doubt an anthem, for no apparent reason was overextended with filler C part and passages portions that added absolutely nothing but rather dragged it forward, at least nothing could tire the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lead guitar stride that took a slight oriental bearing. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Control the Twisted MindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a few annoying over composing like the previous one I mentioned, on the other hand, this particular number exemplified SUICIDAL ANGELSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ attention to details, crafting a track that had several differences in contrast to their previous and current albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s platter. Always on attack mode, this manic obsession banged hard with its ferocity and somewhat innovative arrangement.\n\nProbably still not a gem in the crown jewels of Thrash Metal, yet energetic, feisty, brutal and an old school devoted follower, the old guard would be pleased. Coming from a Metal scene that always had something to do with neck breaking Thrash, SUICIDAL ANGELS are still glorious, defying the commonwealth with their intensity. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Divide And ConquerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ might be for the ones that truly respect Thrash Metal, though I believe that anyone would find some of it to his liking.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6365ecef1cc55f013a50dcd3d3b6dcffa2708075","amp;dn":"Suicidal+Angels+-+Divide+And+Conquer+%28320CBR%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6365ecef1cc55f013a50dcd3d3b6dcffa2708075","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,101,236,239,28,197,95,1,58,80,220,211,211,182,220,255,162,112,128,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
