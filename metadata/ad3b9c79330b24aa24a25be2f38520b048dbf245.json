Barnhart (Editor), Stephen B. Hottman (Editor), Douglas M. Marshall J.D. (Editor), Eric Shappee (Editor)\n\nIntroduction to Unmanned Aircraft Systems is the editorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ response to their unsuccessful search for suitable university-level textbooks on this subject. A collection of contributions from top experts, this book applies the depth of their expertise to identify and survey the fundamentals of unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operations. Written from a nonengineering civilian operational perspective, the book starts by detailing the history of UASs and then explores current technology and what is expected for the future.\n\nCovering all facets of UAS elements and operationÃ¢â‚¬â€including an examination of safety procedures and human factorsÃ¢â‚¬â€this material gives readers a truly complete and practical understanding of what it takes to safely operate UASs for a variety of missions in the National Airspace System.\n\n\nTopics covered include:\n\nThe U.S. aviation regulatory system\nCertificate of authorization process\nUAS for geospatial data\nAutomation and autonomy in UAS\nSensors and payloads\nWith helpful end-of-chapter discussion questions, this resource is designed to give beginning university students and other new entrants to the field a comprehensive, easy-to-understand first overview of the field. The bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s broad scope also makes it useful as a foundation for professionals embarking on further study.\n\n\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Unmanned-Aircraft-Systems-Barnhart/dp/1439835209","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad3b9c79330b24aa24a25be2f38520b048dbf245","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Unmanned+Aircraft+Systems+by+R+K+Barnhart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad3b9c79330b24aa24a25be2f38520b048dbf245","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,59,156,121,51,11,36,170,36,162,91,226,243,133,32,176,72,219,242,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
