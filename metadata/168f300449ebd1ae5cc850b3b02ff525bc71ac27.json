An M.Tech. in Computer Science, she teaches Computer Science to postgraduate students. She is also the Chairperson of the Infosys Foundation. A prolific writer in Kannada, she has written seven novels, four technical books, three travelogues and two collections of short stories. Her previous English book Wise and Otherwise has been translated into thirteen Indian languages. This is her first book for children.\n\nIn this collection, I have tried to recreate some stories from my experiences, all of which have taught me something. In the course of my work for the Infosys Foundation and as a teacher, I meet many people, young and old, each of whom has enriched my life in some way. I have always wanted to tell these stories to the next generation. I hope you will like and enjoy reading them.\n\nGenre: Fiction, Short Story Collection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:168f300449ebd1ae5cc850b3b02ff525bc71ac27","amp;dn":"How+I+Taught+My+Grandmother+to+Read+by+Sudha+Murthy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"168f300449ebd1ae5cc850b3b02ff525bc71ac27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,143,48,4,73,235,209,174,92,200,80,179,176,47,245,37,188,113,172,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
