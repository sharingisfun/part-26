Craig Turner here tells this amazing story â€” a tale of shipwrecks and slavery, of miracles, battles, apparitions, privations and hardship, of spies and bribery, of human sacrifice, and above all, an astonishing journey through a wilderness that took all but four lives out of three hundred. Those who sought to gain the most fared the worst, and those who accepted their terrible fate performed miracles.\r\n\r\nLength: 01:06:43\r\nFiletype: MP3\r\n \nhttps://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org/store/title/the-epic-journey-of-catholic-explorer-cabeza-de-vaca\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this presentation, please seed and support Lighthouse Catholic Media, NFP, which is a 501(c)(3) Not For Profit Company that seeks to answer the call for a New Evangelization.
