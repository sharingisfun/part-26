Second only to Charlie Parker in the DownBeat polls of the day, nobody played alto saxophone as smooth and cool as Art Pepper. Unreleased Art, a three-disc set comprised of two-thirds never-before released material, traces Pepper's life in music from his golden era in the '50s through his prison- interrupted discovery of John Coltrane in the '60s, and concludes with his final period, fresh out of rehab in the '70s and playing as if his life depended on it.\n\nDisc 1 - Pure Art (1951-1960)\n01 - Art Pepper (Rogers) 5:20\n02 - Fascinatin' Rhythm (Gershwin, Gershwin) 4:26\n03 - Patricia (Pepper) 3:38\n04 - Tickle Toe (Young) 2:53\n05 - Pepper Returns (Pepper) 4:27\n06 - Mambo de La Pinta (Pepper) 4:17\n07 - These Foolish Things (RemindMe of You) (Strachey) 2:40\n08 - Cool Bunny (Pepper) 4:15\n09 - Besame Mucho (Skylar, Velasquez) 4:00\n10 - Art's Oregano (Pepper) 3:10\n11 - Diane (Pepper) 3:35\n12 - I Can't Believe That You're in Love with Me (Gaskill, McHugh) 5:24\n13 - Straight Life (Pepper) 2:52\n14 - Everything Happens to Me (Adair, Dennis) 3:07\n15 - Nutmeg (Pepper) 3:13\n16 - What's New?
