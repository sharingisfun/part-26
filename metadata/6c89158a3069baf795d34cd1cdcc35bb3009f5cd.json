Sufferers try them out to see if these natural remedies help relieve their symptoms.\n\nJames also uses peppermint to whip up a fragrant homemade body scrub.\n\n\nThis week's recipes\n\nLemon balm lip salve for cold sores\nPlantain cream for bites and stings\nThyme breath spray\nHerbal body scrub\n\n\n\nFurther information about the programme\n\nJames doesn't believe natural remedies are a replacement for conventional drugs, but they have been used traditionally to ease the symptoms of a range of minor self-limiting disorders. Many plant-based remedies are not clinically tested like conventional drugs because they are traditional recipes that companies cannot patent. If you want to give them a go, just make sure you follow a few common sense guidelines.\n\nBefore you try any of the remedies, make sure you get a proper diagnosis from your doctor. If you have any other existing condition or are taking medicines, or if you are pregnant or breast feeding, then you should take medical advice before using the remedies. You must make sure you follow the recipe closely as well as the advice on dosage, and do a 24-hour skin test to check you are not allergic.\n\nYou will find most of the plants James uses in your own back garden, your fridge or at your local garden centre, but some are found in the wild and could be confused with toxic plants. It is vital you know exactly what you are picking, so use a good plant reference book.\n\nIn the series, people who suffer from various everyday ailments try JamesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s remedies. These are illustrative examples and are not clinical trials. Their opinions are subjective and do not prove if the remedies are effective. Many factors can influence results and the remedies might work for some and not others.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c89158a3069baf795d34cd1cdcc35bb3009f5cd","amp;dn":"Grow.Your.Own.Drugs.S01E04","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c89158a3069baf795d34cd1cdcc35bb3009f5cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,137,21,138,48,105,186,247,149,211,76,209,205,204,53,187,48,9,245,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
