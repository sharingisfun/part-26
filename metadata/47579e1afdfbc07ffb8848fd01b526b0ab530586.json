Denitch insists on the relevance of social democracy to the post-communist world. His combination of jeremiad, analysis, and prescription is reminiscent of much left-wing writing, yet his contribution is distinctive. His criticism of the &quot;antistatist&quot; bias of the left is refreshing. By reviving the traditional categories of liberal capitalist, former communist, and developing regimes, Denitch explains important sources of change. After the Flood brings a distinct voice to the debate about the future of world politics. 180 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47579e1afdfbc07ffb8848fd01b526b0ab530586","amp;dn":"Denitch-After+the+Flood-World+Politics%26Democracy+in+Wake+of+Comm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47579e1afdfbc07ffb8848fd01b526b0ab530586","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,87,158,26,253,251,192,127,251,136,72,253,1,181,38,176,171,83,5,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
