Adaptations of the previous Challenger Class locomotives showed that larger fireboxes, longer boilers and more driving wheels achieved their aims. What followed was the monster Big Boy with its articulated wheel configuration, huge water tank and 68in (173cm) driving wheels.\n\nIn 1941, Alco Locomotive Works delivered 20 Big Boys and another five were put into service in 1944. Although rarely run at such a speed, the Big Boy was capable of an 80mph top speed and towards the end of their life were regularly hauling more than 4,000 tons up the Wasatch gradient unassisted. The last revenue service by a Big Boy was in July 1959 and eight of the original 25 locomotives have been preserved in the USA.\n\nThe Union Pacific Big Boy V2.0 is available for Train Simulator in the famous UP black livery with accurate locomotive simulation, detailed cab interior, full TSX effects, and new smoke and steam particle emitters.\n\nThe Sherman Hills Add-On (available separately) is required to play the scenarios included with this Add-On.\n\nScenarios\nFive scenarios for the Sherman Hill route:\n\nBig Boy Introduction\nBig Boy Local Work Granite to Cheyenne\nBig Boy on Sherman Hill Part 1\nBig Boy on Sherman Hill Part 2\nBig Boy working Laramie Cement\n\nHow to Install:\n\nTrain Simulator 2013 (Will only work with a cracked edition)\nIn the game folder (&quot;...
