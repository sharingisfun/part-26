The tribal &quot;Voodoo&quot;  was one of 2000's best singles. Unfortunately, the group's sophomore effort, Awake, doesn't live up to its predecessor. The first three songs -- &quot;Sick of Life,&quot; &quot;Awake,&quot; and &quot;Greed&quot; -- blend together unanimously into a swirl of Tony Rombola's jackhammer  guitar riffs. It's the deeper cuts that are the standout tracks. The dirgy, slow  groove in &quot;Mistakes&quot; is hook laden. One common thread between Godsmack and Awake is lead singer Sully Erna's angst-ridden lyrics. &quot;Oh God, I'm makin' the same mistakes,&quot; he cries in &quot;Mistakes,&quot; as Rombola's guitars encircle him. Drummer Tommy Stewart, on &quot;Trippin',&quot; aptly pronounces Erna's anger in &quot;Face down/I walk away/Every time I  think I do the right thing/You turn your back on me.&quot; The album opens with the  pronouncement, &quot;I'm gonna do it again.&quot; Probably not. \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Sick of life [03:52] \n 02.Awake [05:04] \n 03.Greed [03:29] \n 04.Bad magick [04:17] \n 05.Goin' down [03:24] \n 06.Mistakes [05:59] \n 07.Trippin' [04:56] \n 08.Forgive me [04:19] \n 09.Vampires [03:47] \n 10.The journey [00:50] \n 11.Spiral [05:35] \n ____ \n \n 45:32 min \n 74,9 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b00b16659b09caa19d1c2cc422a49cd4d0765b74","amp;dn":"Godsmack-Awake-%28Retail%29-2000-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b00b16659b09caa19d1c2cc422a49cd4d0765b74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,11,22,101,155,9,202,161,157,28,44,196,34,164,156,212,208,118,91,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
