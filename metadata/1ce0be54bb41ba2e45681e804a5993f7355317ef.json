At a time when the symphony concert was\na matter of great seriousness for music-lovers, Hoffnung loved to\nsee the funny side of those formalities. His famous cartoons took\nthe instruments of the orchestra - and the characters of the people\nwho played them - and sent them up mercilessly.\n\nIn 1956 Hoffnung had the idea of translating the cartoons into real\nlife. With a combination of realisations of his weird cartoon instruments\nand suitably eccentric compositions to showcase them, the first Hoffnung\nMusic Festival took place at the Royal Festival Hall in London.\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ce0be54bb41ba2e45681e804a5993f7355317ef","amp;dn":"BBC+R3+Documentary+-+%5C%27On+Planet+Hoffnung%5C%27+sp7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ce0be54bb41ba2e45681e804a5993f7355317ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,224,190,84,187,65,186,46,69,104,30,128,74,89,147,247,53,83,23,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
