Siegel MD\n\n\nabout book :-\n\nBetween the ages of 12 and 24, the brain changes in important, and oftentimes maddening, ways. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no wonder that many parents approach their childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adolescence with fear and trepidation. According to renowned neuropsychiatrist Daniel Siegel, however, if parents and teens can work together to form a deeper understanding of the brain science behind all the tumult, they will be able to turn conflict into connection and form a deeper understanding of one another.  \n \nIn Brainstorm, Siegel illuminates how brain development impacts teenagersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ behavior and relationships. Drawing on important new research in the field of interpersonal neurobiology, he explores exciting ways in which understanding how the teenage brain functions can help parents make what is in fact an incredibly positive period of growth, change, and experimentation in their childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives less lonely and distressing on both sides of the generational divide.\n \n\nAbout the Author :-\n\nDaniel J. Siegel, M.D., is clinical professor of psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine, co-director of the UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center, and executive director of the Mindsight Institute. A graduate of Harvard Medical School, he is the coauthor of two classic parenting books: Parenting from the Inside Out (with Mary Hartzell, M.Ed.) and The Whole-Brain Child (with Tina Payne Bryson). Also the author of Mindsight and the internationally acclaimed professional texts The Mindful Brain and The Developing Mind. Dr. Siegel keynotes conferences and presents workshops throughout the world. He lives in Los Angeles with his wife and two children.\n \n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ce2c16eb3e583242c0e6db56e71f57aed81fa7a","amp;dn":"Brainstorm%3A+The+Power+and+Purpose+of+the+Teenage+Brain+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ce2c16eb3e583242c0e6db56e71f57aed81fa7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,226,193,110,179,229,131,36,44,14,109,181,110,113,245,122,237,129,250,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
