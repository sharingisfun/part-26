After embarking on a devastating crime spree for food, clothing and transportation in downtown Tokyo, they are captured by authorities and sent to the infamous lunar prison called Dead Leaves.\n\nAfter a brief incarceration, they discover that the prison is really a top-secret cloning facility, occupied by villainous prison guards and deformed genetic experiments. High-speed frantic action combined with hyper-violent and semi-humorous chase scenes follow as the two decide to break out of the prison with the aid of their fellow mutant inmates.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:816e59f53fee8d8682019cd862a97bfa407048a9","amp;dn":"%5BExiled-Destiny%5D_Dead_Leaves_Movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"816e59f53fee8d8682019cd862a97bfa407048a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,110,89,245,63,238,141,134,130,1,156,216,98,169,123,250,64,112,72,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
