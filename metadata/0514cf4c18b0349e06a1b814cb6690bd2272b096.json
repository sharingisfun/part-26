Bob Saget calls in to discuss diarrhea, talk about his appearance on O&amp;J, his book Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dirty Daddy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the possibility of a Full House reunion. Ant goes through a list of people who got fired for tweets, Ebola jokes, drunk tweeting, and looks at the Paltalk cameras. We watch an ass clapping video, hear a song about Ã¢â‚¬Å“family values,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ see a clip of an altercation at the Dallas airport, and we learn how rednecks have fun with Tannerite. We see a pisser of a gal on the subway, an ass blowing video, one of a drunk chick, and then get into the selection of costumes that Walmart is selling. Ant ends the show talking about Rev AlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creepy weight loss and by showing us a video of this incredible shrinking douchebag.\n\nYesterdays upload was incorrect.
