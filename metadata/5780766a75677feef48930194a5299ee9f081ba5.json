With the assistance of his secretary Kathleen (Lucille Ball), he dives deep into a mystery in search of answers. Galt turns the tables on the man following him (William Bendix), who claims to be a private eye named Foss, hired by Galt's sworn enemy, a corrupt lawyer named Tony Jardine. In the meantime, Jardine has begun having an affair with the much-younger wife of Hardy Cathcart (Clifton Webb), a wealthy art-gallery owner. It appears that Jardine is setting up Galt to take another fall. But it turns out Foss is not a private eye but a thug named Stauffer, secretly working for Cathcart. He ambushes Galt, knocking him out with ether, then murders Jardine and places a bloody poker in Galt's hand. Kathleen has fallen in love with Galt, so she aids him in covering up the crime and in trying to find out who's behind it. Cathcart, rather than pay off Stauffer, pushes him through a window to his death. It appears Cathcart has thought of everything, but just as he is about to eliminate Galt at the art gallery, someone else arrives to ruin Cathcart's diabolical plan.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 592 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 99 mins\nSubtitles: English, Francais, Espanol\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5780766a75677feef48930194a5299ee9f081ba5","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Corner+%281946%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Subs-Eng-Sp+-+Lucille+Ball%2C+Cl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5780766a75677feef48930194a5299ee9f081ba5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,128,118,106,117,103,127,238,244,137,48,25,74,82,153,238,159,8,27,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
