Since it was already scanned I though I should post it for those people who remember the series.\n\nMeet Clay Washburn, who in the 1930s and 1940s, tries to make a living by cranking out fiction for the popular &quot;pulp&quot; magazines of the day and struggles with whatever life puts in his path. In addition to Clay's world, in each issue, you also often see the adventures of the fictional characters that he is working on\n\nAnd before anyone asks...NO, i do not have the other issues, if while perusing comic shops I happen to come across them I might pick them up if the price is right.\n\nPlease seed and enjoy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:062a81cb905e151a513bab718a2eed6c8620c874","amp;dn":"Wordsmith+07+%281997%29+Caliber+Comics+Dave+Darrigo+%26amp%3B+R.G.+Taylo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"062a81cb905e151a513bab718a2eed6c8620c874","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,42,129,203,144,94,21,26,81,59,171,113,138,46,237,108,134,32,200,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
