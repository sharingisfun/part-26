It will give the 3dm popup, but then it should load after pressing the button. If you experience a problem, try moving the directory out of Program files to something like c:games or something that doesn't require admin permissions.\n\nI wanted to share this because a lot of conflicting stuff is out there that doesn't work or only works for some people.\n\nAnyway, all glory to 3dm.\nI'd say this is a repack, but it wasn't packed in the first place. I took the preload files, decrypted them with the decrypter, added the v2 dlc/crack stuff and it just works...\n\nI've split each rar file into 1.95GB chunks.\nIt uses rar5 format.\n\nenjoy,\nmurph","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b4692307bc84beac5c67a7d639b6a07458922fa","amp;dn":"Mad.Max.w.Update0.v2-3DMGAME","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b4692307bc84beac5c67a7d639b6a07458922fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,70,146,48,123,200,75,234,197,198,122,125,99,155,106,7,69,137,34,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
