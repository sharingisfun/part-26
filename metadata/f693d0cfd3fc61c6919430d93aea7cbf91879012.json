Jean-FranÃƒÂ§ois (Emmanuel Bilodeau) is a fortysomething single father in a rural Quebec town; he's divorced from his ex-wife Rosie, who now bides her time in jail for an unspecified crime. Their daughter, Julyvonne (Philomene Bilodeau), is 12 years old and has a most unconventional lifestyle: instead of sending her to school, Jean-FranÃƒÂ§ois keeps her at home while he's off working two jobs - one as a bowling alley maintenance man, and the other as a motel housekeeper. Home schooling may not be a concept unique to this clan, but Jean-FranÃƒÂ§ois's educational methods are sketchy and questionable at best, and have put the adolescent severely behind other kids her age, in addition to making her socially withdrawn and vacant. One day, Julyvonne stumbles onto a startling discovery in the woods near the family home, and in lieu of reporting it as most children would, she reacts in an unusual way which reveals just how troubled she has become. Meanwhile, Jean-FranÃƒÂ§ois suddenly grows exhausted with the father-daughter dynamic, decides to leave home permanently, and promptly instructs Julyvonne to raise herself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f693d0cfd3fc61c6919430d93aea7cbf91879012","amp;dn":"Curling+2010+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f693d0cfd3fc61c6919430d93aea7cbf91879012","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,147,208,207,211,252,97,198,145,148,48,217,58,234,124,191,145,135,144,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
