Here is a great extended PAL DVD version of the classic\n Muppet Movie, restoring a number of scenes and shots later cut of the film.\n\nIt's rare enough that not a lot of people know about it, but there are indeed\n two edits of The Muppet Movie out there - the familiar version and a longer\n edit which has never been made available on DVD. It turned up on VHS in England\n in the 1980s.\n\nI was especially impressed by the ending of this version, which is I think\n exponentially better than the theatrical ending. We hear the Muppets talking\n over the end credits, as they talk about the movie and their roles in it. It's\n funny and sweet and very Muppety. The audio is the only difference here - a big\n difference.\n\nAnd then there's the full version of Rowlf and Kermit's song &quot;I Hope That\n Something Better Comes Along,&quot; which is excellent.\n\n[Both clips are available at Yootoob from user ocpmovie2.]\n\nWe also get more footage of the evil Doc Hopper, and other little moments\n throughout.\n\nThe author, who is British so his DVD is in PAL format, has taken an old VHS \nof the extended version, and edited the extra footage into a nice high quality\n DVD version of the film, so that we can all enjoy it. For the most part you're\n watching the theatrical cut in DVD quality, but then for the extended clips we\n cut to lower quality VHS footage. It's certainly noticeable but not jarring,\n especially since the audio is edited smoothly. I did notice that sometimes he\n used the lower quality VHS for shots that were still in the theatrical cut in\n some form, but perhaps the shots were cut shorter in the theatrical cut or\n something.\n\nThe VHS he used was apparently pretty much a &quot;full screen&quot; &quot;open matte&quot;\n transfer, rather than pan &amp; scanned, so we don't lose much if any picture when\n it's cropped to widescreen. Certainly when we cut from his VHS footage to DVD\n footage, I don't see much if any difference in the framing of shots. Very nice.\n\n\nWhen originally released in theaters in England (and possibly elsewhere), the\n runtime of the film was 97.5 minutes or so. Many small scenes were cut from the\n film to reach the current 94 minute running time. The original longer version\n has become very rare for some reason, but was released in England on PAL\n laserdisc and home video during the 1980s. Most notably the longer version has\n a different (and better) ending, where the Muppets talk to each other during\n the credits, talking about how they did in the movie. This is a very funny\n scene. Also, the full version of &quot;I Hope That Something Better Comes Along&quot;\n is performed by Rowlf and Kermit, with several more verses than in the 94\n minute version.\n\nThe longer version, as released on video in England in the 80s, contains the\n following extended scenes:\n\nExtended shots of Kermit entering the bar where Fozzie is performing, after the\n James Coburn cameo.\n\nMore of Fozzie being heckled in the bar. He honks a horn which falls apart.\n &quot;This is not my night.&quot;\n\nExtra shots as Doc Hopper and Max watch Fozzie and Kermit dance in the bar. A\n little bit more dancing and more of the crowd manhandling Kermit and Fozzie.\n\nAn extended commercial for Doc Hopper's Frog Legs. More of Doc Hopper asking\n Kermit to be his spokesman.\n\nExtra Fozzie in &quot;Moving right along.&quot; &quot;A bear in his natural habitat - a\n Studebaker.&quot;\n\nEven more Doc Hopper trying to convince Kermit. &quot;Shut up, Max!&quot;\n\nIn the church, an extended recap of the entire movie by Dr. Teeth - we see shots\n from previous scenes. It's not clear if this was actually in the version which\n screened in theaters, or if it was added for the video version, as the \nlaserdisc version seems to have been edited on video. (Because this is a recap,\n the version on this fan DVD still has DVD picture quality - the author was able\n to use footage from earlier, excluding one shot of Doc Hopper.)\n\nDoc Hopper and Max chase Kermit and Fozzie. Max asks what his cut of a million\n is. A whole extra car chase scene of Max trying to catch up to Fozzie and\n Kermit, and failing.\n\nAn alternate musical arrangement on Never Before, Never Again. (The UK and\n Canadian releases of the soundtrack LP feature yet another recording of the\n song...)\n\nGreat extended version of Rowlf and Kermit dueting on &quot;I Hope That Something\n Better Comes Along,&quot; with about two or three more verses. &quot;A laddy needs a\n lassie.&quot; &quot;Come father's day, the litterbug's gonna get ya.&quot; (For some reason,\n on the fan DVD the lower quality footage covers much of the sequence, even\n though some of it is actually in the theatrical cut, such as &quot;She made a monkey\n out of old king kong&quot; and the final verse.)\n\nExtra shot of Giant Animal laughing at the bad guys (possibly deleted because\n Animal's fingers were thought to look unconvincing - just a guess from me).\n\nLESS reaction shots in Orson Welles scene than the shorter version - strange.\n\nA lot more explosion and set destruction footage when Crazy Harry blows up the\n set at the end, before &quot;Life's like a movie.&quot; Seems like padding really. It's\n set to circus-y music.\n\nExtended and alternate ending in the movie theater - Sweetums says &quot;I just knew\n I'd catch up to you guys.&quot; All Muppets talk and say funny things over ending\n credits. Robin says Kermit is a great actor. Fozzie wants to hear that he was\n funny in the movie, but no one will tell him that except Kermit. Muppets are in\n character for the entire credits. Music is also different in this section.\n Apart from Sweetums shots, picture quality doesn't change for this addition as\n only sound is changed.\n\n\nTimecode Cause Lost/gained Notes\nAudio Content (dialogue)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0:01:01:15 Film break -0:00:00:04\n0:01:41:01 Film break -0:00:00:02\n0:02:13:11 Film break -0:00:00:01\n0:03:18:14 Film break -0:00:00:07\n0:07:25:10 Film break -0:00:00:01\n0:08:07:02 Film break -0:00:00:01\n0:11:26:21 Film break -0:00:00:04\n0:11:47:13 Cut -0:00:00:10 Trim handle/start\n0:12:04:02 Cut -0:00:00:11 Trim handle/start\n0:14:12:19 Cut -0:00:10:05 Edit end/3 shots/handle\nFozzie: &quot;Hey hey hey hey, I got it, I got it!&quot; [horn breaks] &quot;This is\nnot my night...&quot;\n0:14:51:20 Cut -0:00:00:21 Trim handle/start\nMusic change; lasts until next cut\n0:15:19:10 Cut -0:00:08:11 Edit end/start\nCamera pans from window to show Doc Hopper poster on wall\n0:15:42:05 Cut -0:00:06:00 Edit handle/shot/handle\nKermit being manhandled: &quot;Frogs are ticklish, guys!&quot;\n0:17:09:22 Film break -0:00:00:01\n0:19:07:04 Cut -0:00:18:06 Edit handle/3 shots/handle\nAlt. take on &quot;If you want/Just a snack&quot; plus &quot;So like we say down at\nDoc Hopper's, 'Hop on down to Hopper's!'
