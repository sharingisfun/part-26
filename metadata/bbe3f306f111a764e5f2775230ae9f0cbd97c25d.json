However,          \r\n encountering many obstacles along the path, you will need to solve      \r\n elaborate puzzles in order to obtain key items or documents, diaries    \r\n and notes that will shed at least a faint streak of light on the dark   \r\n mystery surrounding the whole &quot;science&quot; experiment.                     \r\n                                                                         \r\n With Retrospective Mode you will be able to see behind the fabric of    \r\n the physical world.
