Yet House Davion rebounded, becoming one of the most powerful of Houses. Since then Avalon City and the capital of the Federated Suns have stood as a beacon of hope for all mankind.\n\nThen came the Jihad.\n\nJihad Turning Points: New Avalon fleshes out the details of the conflict surrounding this pivotal world published in various Jihad Plot Sourcebooks. Additionally, players can join one of the myriad of forces fighting for controlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and survivalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½of the Federated SunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s capital world.\n\nThis campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns and even create their own scenarios with optional rules to give their games a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNew Avalon flavor.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The ebook includes a detailed map of the world of New Avalon, a run down of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide invasion. Only the playersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ imaginations are the limits.\n\n\nThank you to the guys and gals who share and make these Classic BattleTech book collection possible.
