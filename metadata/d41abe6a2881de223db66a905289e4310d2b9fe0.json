Excello Records' first foray into albums came with this wonderful collection of singles by Lightnin' Slim largely issued around the success of the title track, an R&amp;B hit in 1960. &quot;Long Leanie Mama,&quot; &quot;My Starter Won't Work,&quot; &quot;It's Mighty Crazy,&quot; &quot;Hoo-Doo Blues,&quot; &quot;Tom Cat Blues,&quot; &quot;Lightnin' Troubles,&quot; &quot;G.I. Slim&quot; and &quot;Feelin' Awful Blues&quot; are all certified swamp blues classics and about as lowdown as the genre can get possibly get. With Lazy Lester on harmonica for the majority of the tracks here, the stripped-down approach to Slim's brand of blues casts these sides in a decidedly front-porch ambience with the added pulsating tape echo and oddball percussive effects just making everything on here sound even more doom-laden. &quot;Lightnin's Blues,&quot; the John Lee Hooker-inspired &quot;Just Made Twenty One&quot; and &quot;Sugar Plum,&quot; the A-side and both sides of his first and third singles for Excello, are the three bonus CD tracks appended to the original track lineup on this 1998 CD reissue. An essential blues purchase. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d41abe6a2881de223db66a905289e4310d2b9fe0","amp;dn":"Lightnin%27+Slim+-+Rooster+Blues+1960","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d41abe6a2881de223db66a905289e4310d2b9fe0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,26,190,106,40,129,222,34,61,182,106,144,82,137,228,49,13,43,159,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
