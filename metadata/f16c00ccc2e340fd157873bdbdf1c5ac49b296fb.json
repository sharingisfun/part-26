Conditions apply.\n\nTo avoid unwanted roaming costs being generated abroad by the Live Traffic Service (where applicable), please carefully review your settings in the Config Wizzard.\n\nINSTALLATION AND SETUP\nPlease note that since iPod touch and iPad (WiFi only) do not have built-in GPS-receivers, an external GPS-receiver is required. Compatible are only those which are officially supported by Apple. Due to the size of the package, we recommend purchasing and downloading the application via iTunes.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Background navigation has to be turned on, you can do this under &quot;Settings / Advanced settings&quot;.\n\nWe would like to inform you that according to the new French regulations, safety camera databases cannot be used in France any more, therefore it is no longer included in the package. Regarding the regulation coming to effect, please inform yourself through official forums/bodies!\nPlease read more at http://www.igomyway.com/igo-my-way-for-iphone/france","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f16c00ccc2e340fd157873bdbdf1c5ac49b296fb","amp;dn":"Europe+iGO+Primo+App+v+2.5.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f16c00ccc2e340fd157873bdbdf1c5ac49b296fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,108,0,204,194,227,64,253,21,120,115,189,189,241,197,172,73,178,150,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
