He has one of the most distinctive voices you'll ever hear.  This album is great for late night listening, or a romantic candle-lit evening.\n\nScott has had a long and illustrious career in music, working with many of the greats.  He became known to a younger contemporary audience in 1991 when he appeared in the final episode of David Lynch's smash-hit TV series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.  Scott was also featured the following year, 1992, on the soundtrack to David Lynch's film &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me&quot;.\n\nScott was born in 1925, and is still alive at time of writing - currently aged 88.\n\n\n==\nThis is Scott's only album available here.  These files are MP3, and it is hoped that this torrent will be better seeded than the (currently un-seeded) FLAC version of this album.\n==","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e70f0c1834f37ed727688c6386bc78863bac153c","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Scott+-+All+The+Way+%281992%29+%28mp3%29+%28jazz%29+%28Twin+Peaks%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e70f0c1834f37ed727688c6386bc78863bac153c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,15,12,24,52,243,126,215,39,104,140,99,134,188,120,134,59,172,21,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
