We get the Indian fighter and hero of New Orleans facing down South Carolina radicals' efforts to nullify federal laws they found unacceptable, speaking the words of democracy even if his banking and other policies strengthened local oligarchies, and doing nothing to protect southern Indians from their land-hungry white neighbors. For the first time, with Jackson, demagoguery became presidential, and his Democratic Party deepened its identification with Southern slavery. Relying on the huge mound of previous Jackson studies, Meacham can add little to this well-known story, save for the few tidbits he's unearthed in private collections rarely consulted before. What he does bring is a writer's flair and the ability to relate his story without the incrustations of ideology and position taking that often disfigure more scholarly studies of Jackson. Nevertheless, a gifted writer like Meacham might better turn his attention to tales less often told and subjects a bit tougher to enliven. 32 pages of b&amp;w photos.

The rip-roaring two-fisted man of the people, duelist, passionate lover, gambler and war hero, was also a prime creator of the presidency as the fulcrum of executive power to defend democracyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Meacham argues that Jackson should be in the pantheon with Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln for this and for his role in preserving the Union and rescuing democracy from elitism. He makes the historianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s case with wit and scholarship but Meacham also has the novelistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s art of enthralling the general reader much as David McCullough did for the lesser figure of John Adams. Reading ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAmerican LionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ one is no longer able to look on the gaunt, craggy face on the $20 bill without hearing the tumult of America in the making.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n--Tina Brown\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJon Meacham's splendid new book on Andrew Jackson shrewdly places presidential politics in the context of Jackson's family life -- and vice versa. With an abundance of gripping stories, and with admirable fairness, Meacham offers a fresh portrait of one of the most controversial and consequential men ever to occupy the White House.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n--Sean Wilentz, Princeton University, author of The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln\n\n\n&quot;Every so often a terrific biography comes along that shines a new light on a familiar figure in American history. So it was with David McCullough and John Adams, so it was with Walter Isaacson and Benjamin Franklin, so it is with Jon Meacham and Andrew Jackson. A master storyteller, Meacham interweaves the lives of Jackson and the members of his inner circle to create a highly original book.&quot;\n--Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd52c3fee0fb62975e575074ca91a9c007e30904","amp;dn":"American+Lion%3A+Andrew+Jackson+In+The+White+House","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd52c3fee0fb62975e575074ca91a9c007e30904","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,82,195,254,224,251,98,151,94,87,80,116,202,145,169,192,7,227,9,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
