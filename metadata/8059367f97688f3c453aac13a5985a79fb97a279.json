Alex shows us how to make roasted oats and dried fruit cereal after a visit to the Farmers Market. Back on the road, Alex and Matt pop into a small brewery in Cowaramup where brewmaster Jeremy Good presses the two into service Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mixing all the grain and ingredients by hand with a rake. Then it's off to see German baker Gottard for wood-fired bread at Yallingup before Matt needs to get back to the gourmet festival. Amid the banter and laughs with Hong Kong's Chef Alvin Leung, Matt makes a tasty and healthy quinoa, avocado, radish and pickled lemon salad. The duo learn about the history of a Greek church built in the style of small village churches from Crete, and witness a special service to thank the fire-fighters who saved the church from a bushfire exactly one year ago. In this season finale, Alex, Matt and all the producers they have met in the previous six weeks arrive for a drink and try all the dishes theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made with their wonderful produce.\n\n\n\n\nRebroadcast Air Date: 15-Oct-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8059367f97688f3c453aac13a5985a79fb97a279","amp;dn":"Recipes.That.Rock.S01E06.Finale.PDTV.x264-Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8059367f97688f3c453aac13a5985a79fb97a279","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,89,54,127,151,104,143,60,69,58,172,19,165,152,90,121,251,151,162,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
