Debt, she says, is like air: something we take for granted until things go wrong. And then, while gasping for breath, we become very interested in it. She writes, &quot;These are not lectures about how to get out of debt; rather, they're about the debtor/creditor twinship in the broadest sense, from human sacrifice to pawnshops to revenge. In this light, what we owe and how we pay is a feature of all human societies, and profoundly shapes our shared values and our cultures.&quot;\n\nThis is part 5 of 5.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7d18030d8f2a8bc34c0b1721f5c95894d15335f","amp;dn":"CBC+Ideas+2008+Massey+Lectures+-+part+5+of+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7d18030d8f2a8bc34c0b1721f5c95894d15335f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,209,128,48,216,242,168,188,52,192,177,114,31,92,149,137,77,21,51,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
