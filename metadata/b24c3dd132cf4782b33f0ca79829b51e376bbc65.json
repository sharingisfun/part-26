Each song begs to be ignored within the opening seconds; inaudible screams litter across distorted feedback with little hints of a clever rhythm section. Take Grave Desecration for example which has so many elements riding with it you could throw a dart at a genre board and come away a winner. The band know how to work their blending of styles with sexy transitions that seamlessly weave their way in-between tracks, like the acoustic outro that graces the end of the aforementioned song; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a curve ball thrown at the listener after the two minute tirade that precedes it, still the moment has never felt so perfect.&quot;\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.
