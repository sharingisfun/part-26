YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have Dukes Of Haggle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the latest iteration of the still-going-strong Ã¢â‚¬Å“found moneyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reality TV genre. Discovery Channel has ordered 12 episodes of Dukes Of Haggle, to debut tomorrow night. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about four rival teams of barterers working in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“barter economy that exists along the backroads of the American South,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the network explained. These teams scour the south to barter-up at barns, swap meets and other, less likely places. Apparently the bartering business is becoming more competitive there. Once theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve collected their Prohibition-era kegerators, Civil War swords, Colonel Sanders windvanes and giant faux corn ears, they take them to auction Friday night at NealÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Auction House which is apparently a community ritual second only to Sunday church going.
