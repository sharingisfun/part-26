This renowned text is virtually unknown in its original form outside the Spanish-speaking world.\r\n\r\nIn a text that reads like a mix between a recipe book and an alchemical manuscript, authors Miguel Merchan, Javier DeFelipe, and Fernando de Castro (descendant of the 1933 publication's author) put the new translation into historical context. This book is also beautifully illustrated with plates of histological techniques, provides a quick guide to new vocabulary, and the author's notes on the translated text. This pivotal work of classic neurohistological techniques is a wonderful addition to the Cajal library","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7891f7b37cef55a69d54dd34a7f66bf596816f55","amp;dn":"Cajal+and+De+Castros+Neurohistological+Methods+%282016%29+%5BUnitedVRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7891f7b37cef55a69d54dd34a7f66bf596816f55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,145,247,179,124,239,85,166,157,84,221,52,167,246,107,245,150,129,111,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
