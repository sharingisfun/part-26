They released three albums: The Very Dab (1979), Distinguishing Marks (1980), and Beat Noir (1981). The latter, featured here, is in my opinion their best work, blending post-punk/new wave influences with very catchy hooks. They earned some critical recognition and notable appearances on John Peels radio show and the BBCs &quot;In Concert&quot; radio series. The group split in 1985 and ONeill and Burns went on to form The Silencers, who played well into the 90s.\n\nThere is another version of this album with the songs in a different order and the inclusion of the great &quot;Echohead&quot; and &quot;Famous Last Words&quot;, but these arent on MY version of the album!\n\nTracks :\n01 The Beat Escape 3:43\t\n02 Shadowed 3:07\t\n03 Changing 3:46\t\n04 Get Civilised 4:35\t\n05 Catwalk 4:08\t\n06 The Chase 5:15\t\n07 Touch Sense 4:22\t\n08 Going Going Gone 3:52\t\n\nMusicians : \nJimme ONeill Guitar, Vocals\nCha Burnz Guitar, Vocals\nKenny Alton Bass, Vocals\nJohn Earle Saxophone\nRon Francois Bass\nDick Hanson Trumpet\nKrzystof Kafka Accordion\nSteven King Keyboards\nSadie the Cat Vocals\nDon Snow Keyboards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41be7da6bbfe0eec3c4aba5212e6b7da9df9b946","amp;dn":"Fingerprintz+-+Beat+Noir+%281981%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41be7da6bbfe0eec3c4aba5212e6b7da9df9b946","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,190,125,166,187,254,14,236,60,74,186,82,18,230,183,218,157,249,185,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
