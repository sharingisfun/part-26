In the past, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen the trainers join forces to help singles, couples and families lose weight. This time, they'll take on the remarkable task of saving an entire town.\n\nArarat in western Victoria is one of AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most overweight towns, with 68% of the adult population being overweight or obese. The trainers will take 14 local champions and the rest of the town on a journey to weight loss, health and fitness.\n\nIt's never been done on this scale before, anywhere. The Biggest Loser: Challenge Australia is sure to surprise, entertain, inspire and prove that obesity in Australian communities can indeed be overcome.\n\nIt's last chance training, and for one contestant it becomes too much and they have a meltdown during the session. Meanwhile, someone is called out on the scales for not working hard enough.\n\n*** no, you haven't missed one - somehow episode numbers have got out of step so I an adjusting the numbering to match the Biggest Loser website numbering.  It seems that what was uploaded as episode 6 was in fact ep 6 &amp; 7 apologies.***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d88afdb53bac24ad579985dfbc2d2aee72ee9390","amp;dn":"The.Biggest.Loser.AU.s09e15.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d88afdb53bac24ad579985dfbc2d2aee72ee9390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,138,253,181,59,172,36,173,87,153,133,223,188,45,42,238,114,238,147,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
