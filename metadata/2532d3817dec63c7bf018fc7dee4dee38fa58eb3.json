Today, charismatic teaching is so widespread that it is often the default doctrinal position and is rarely challenged. Christians are being taught that as long as we are â€œgospel centered,â€ what we teach about the Holy Spirit and His work does not matter. \r\n\r\nOf course, it does matter. And whatâ€™s at stake is nothing less than our understanding of salvation and sanctification, and our view of Scriptureâ€™s authority. In his new book, Strange Fire, John MacArthur critiques the charismatic movement, exposing the faultyâ€”and in some cases blasphemousâ€”teaching and practices that are misleading hundreds of millions of people. His biblical defense of the Person and work of the Spirit will equip you to discern the errors of charismatic teaching, help you minister to those caught up in the movement, and will deepen your understanding of and love for the Spirit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2532d3817dec63c7bf018fc7dee4dee38fa58eb3","amp;dn":"Strange+Fire_+The+Danger+of+Off+-+MacArthur%2C+John.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2532d3817dec63c7bf018fc7dee4dee38fa58eb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,50,211,129,125,236,99,199,191,1,143,199,222,228,222,227,143,165,142,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
