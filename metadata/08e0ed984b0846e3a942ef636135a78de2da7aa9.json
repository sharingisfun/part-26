And he's been at it for over thirty years, producing illustrations for clients such as Adobe and Pixar. Follow along in this course with the development of his latest work, Amsterdam Mist, and learn how to apply his techniques to your own artwork in Photoshop or Illustrator. Bert concentrates on the structures in the painting: the bridges and buildings that make up the incredibly detailed canal scene. He'll show how to model elements like railings, curbs, windows, posts, staircases, lamps, and even flags. He'll also create textures and show how to repurpose them throughout the painting. Join him on this journey to the Netherlands and return with souvenirs that you can add to your artistic toolbox.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08e0ed984b0846e3a942ef636135a78de2da7aa9","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Bert+Monroy%3A+The+Making+of+Amsterdam+Mist%2C+the+Structure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08e0ed984b0846e3a942ef636135a78de2da7aa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,224,237,152,75,8,70,227,169,66,239,99,97,53,167,141,226,218,122,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
