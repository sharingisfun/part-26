It features every extant note Parker recorded for the Verve label as well as his appearances at Jazz at the Philharmonic. Parker recorded for Verve primarily in the last five years of his life, a period during which, besides playing with his famous quintet, he experimented with strings, Afro-Cuban jazz and mixed chorus. Among the albums produced during ParkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Verve years were Bird &amp; Diz, Charlie Parker with Strings, and Swedish Schnapps.\n\nTrack listing\n\n    Original 10 CD release Bird: The Complete Charlie Parker on Verve, 1990 (Verve)\n\nDisc: 6\n\n1-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Au PrivaveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 2 Alternate take - LP) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:38\n2-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Au PrivaveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 3 Master) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:43\n3-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“She RoteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 3 Alternate take - LP) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:09\n4-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“She RoteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Take 5 Master) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3:06\n5-  Ã¢â‚¬Å“K.C.
