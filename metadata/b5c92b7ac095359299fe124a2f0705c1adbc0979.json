She likes him because he's taught her much, and he likes her because she's learning so well - and wants to often. Both are very tolerant in matters of extramarital affairs, so he doesn't mind the young Marie-Ange coming over every so often, although she obviously wants more than talk from his wife. But Emmanuelle is more fascinated by the older Bee, and joins her on a trip into the jungle.  \n\n\n Cast \n\n\tAlain Cuny\t... \tMario\n\tSylvia Kristel\t... \tEmmanuelle\n\tMarika Green\t... \tBee\n\tDaniel Sarky\t... \tJean\n\tJeanne Colletin\t... \tAriane\n\tChristine Boisson\t... \tMarie-Ange\n\tSamantha\t\t\n\tGabriel Briand\t\t(as Gaby Brian)\n\tGregory\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5c92b7ac095359299fe124a2f0705c1adbc0979","amp;dn":"Emmanuelle+%281974%29+Just+Jaeckin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5c92b7ac095359299fe124a2f0705c1adbc0979","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,201,43,122,192,149,53,146,153,254,18,74,47,7,5,193,173,188,9,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
