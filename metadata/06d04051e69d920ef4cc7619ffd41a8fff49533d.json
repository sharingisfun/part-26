As the games have grown to be more sophisticated and realistic, video game music has also evolved; from the simple bleeps of arcade shoot-em-ups to todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s robust orchestrations, written for complex action or adventure titles on platforms like Xbox, Playstation and Nintendo.\nConsequently, classical music has made an entrance into the realm of gaming. Last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s collaboration with London Philharmonic Orchestra and conductor Andrew Skeet resulted in The Greatest Video Game Music, an album featuring classical renditions of the most beloved video games.\nResponding to the popularity and the massive feedback to The Greatest Video Game Music a sequel was recorded. This time having fans from all over the world vote for their favorite video game theme. These themes were once again performed by The London Philharmonic Orchestra, one of the most reputable orchestras in the world, and conducted by sensational Andrew Skeet.
