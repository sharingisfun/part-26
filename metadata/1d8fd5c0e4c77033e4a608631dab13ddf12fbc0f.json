Drowned as a witch, Hawise pays a high price for that smile, but for a girl like her in Elizabethan York, there is nowhere to go and nowhere to hide. Four and a half centuries later, Grace Trewe, who has travelled the world, is trying to outrun the memories of being caught up in the Boxing Day tsunami. Her stay in York is meant to be a brief one. But in York Grace discovers that time can twist and turn in ways she never imagined. Drawn inexorably into HawiseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, Grace finds that this time she cannot move on. Will she too be engulfed in the power of the past?\n\n\nThis is a multi-tracker torrent.  Please check your Bit-Torrent client for the true number of seeds.
