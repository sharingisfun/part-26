The chapters, written by specialists in the field, explore in rich empirical detail the complexities involved when such groups - like the skinheads in Hungary, the farmers' 'Self Defence' movement in Poland or the war-veterans in Croatia - challenge the state, engage in community activism, or get involved in protest actions. It also offers a contrasting perspective by focusing on similar activities by the alleged 'pro-democratic' actors of civil society, such as Impulse 99 in the Czech Republic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2280d88a69c5a0ab29a3895b4ee8b15714a3b7a9","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2003%5D+Uncivil+Society+Contentious+Politics+in+Post-Commun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2280d88a69c5a0ab29a3895b4ee8b15714a3b7a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,128,216,138,105,197,160,171,41,163,137,91,78,232,177,87,20,163,183,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
