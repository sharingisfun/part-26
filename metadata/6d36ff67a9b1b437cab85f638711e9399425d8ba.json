His two obsessions have served him well. He and Chris beat the odds and stayed together through high school, college, and right on to the NBA.\n\nBut life under fameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s microscope isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t easy, especially when two men are pretending to be frat-buddies so the world doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the next best thing to married. Their relationship survives the sacrifices they make and the lies they tell to stay together, but when their secret is exposed, the fallout might destroy them when nothing else could.\n\nChris and basketball are the two things holding Xander together. Now the world is asking Xander to make a choice. Is there an option that includes a future with the man he loves?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d36ff67a9b1b437cab85f638711e9399425d8ba","amp;dn":"The+Locker+Room+by+Amy+Lane","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d36ff67a9b1b437cab85f638711e9399425d8ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,54,255,103,169,177,180,55,202,184,95,99,135,17,233,57,148,37,216,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
