Its first single, &quot;Nine Million Bicycles&quot;, became Melua's first top five hit in the UK and caused controversy when science writer Simon Singh said the lyrics &quot;demonstrates a deep ignorance of cosmology and no understanding of the scientific method&quot;. The second single was a double A-side comprising &quot;I Cried for You&quot; and a cover of The Cure's &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot;. The former song was written after Melua met the writer of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail and is about Jesus and Mary Magdalene, while the latter was recorded for the soundtrack to the film Just Like Heaven. The single peaked outside the UK top twenty, and the album's third single, &quot;Spider's Web&quot; (which Melua wrote when she was eighteen, during the Iraq war) did not reach the top forty. Melua wrote the title song &quot;Piece by Piece&quot; after she broke up with her boyfriend Luke Pritchard, and &quot;Half Way up the Hindu Kush&quot; was written by Katie and Mike Batt as a joke playing on the innuendo implicit in the title phrase, which cropped up in a conversation about scarves on a train journey. Katie wrote the chorus and Mike the verses. Alongside covers of &quot;Blues in the Night&quot; and Canned Heat's &quot;On the Road Again&quot;, the album includes &quot;Thank You, Stars&quot;, which was previously released as a B-side on Melua's debut single &quot;The Closest Thing to Crazy&quot; in 2003.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review  By Kevin Maidment - Piece By Piece -- the second album from Georgia-born chanteuse cum naturalised Brit, Katie Melua, and the successor to her multi-million selling Call Off The Search--begins teasingly with the soft-peddled &quot;come hither&quot; jazz flirtations of &quot;Shy Boy&quot; and concludes with the whispering philosophical torch song resignation of &quot;I Do Believe In Love&quot;.  The two songs represent opposite ends of the emotional spectrum--sultry and kittenish on the one hand, solitary and ruminative on the other--but they also offer clues that the cutesy, crazy, easy listening Melua of Mike Batt's mentorship may be gradually acceding to the full bloom of self-determined musical adulthood. Melua's songs are often the more fretful and organic, the ghostly title track and the lovely &quot;I Cried for You&quot; are especially recommended, while the bluesier numbers (particularly the cover of the classic &quot;Blues In The Night&quot;) seem shoehorned-in gratuitously to match an anticipated demographic. Batt's contributions are melodic, memorably buoyant and childlike, the Chinese-flavoured &quot;Nine Million Bicycles&quot; and the naggingly catchy &quot;Halfway Up The Hindu Kush&quot; are both charming despite their naive, pseudo-ethnicity and currently offer, particularly when compared to something as ponderously wooly as &quot;Spider's Web&quot;, a necessary fun counterbalance to Melua's burgeoning compositional skills. At this stage, Piece By Piece fits together nicely like a little jigsaw puzzle. And even if it didn't, Melua would still sound simply ambrosial singing from a washing machine repair manual.\n\nReverend Lee Power, All Music Guide - Georgia-born (as in the country, not the state) singer/songwriter Katie Melua found herself atop the British charts in 2003 with her breezy debut, Call Off the Search, which sold over three million copies in Europe alone. Her laid-back blend of blues, jazz, and pop with a kiss of worldbeat drew comparisons to Norah Jones, and rightfully so. She sticks to the formula on her lush, ultimately safe follow-up, Piece by Piece. This is Coldplay for the Diana Krall crowd, a perfectly rendered slice of adult contemporary pie for a lazy summer day delivered by an artist whose beautiful voice is almost striking in how unremarkable it is. Her longtime collaborator, producer/songwriter Mike Batt, provides the catchiest number, an odd and endearing little confection called &quot;Nine Million Bicycles.&quot; It's both silly and sweet, two things that work in Melua's favor. Sure, she can vamp it up with the best of them on bluesy asides like &quot;Shy Boy&quot; and the dreadful &quot;Blues in the Night,&quot; but there's a whole lot of innocence in that voice that just shrivels in the midst of all that bravado. Only in her early twenties, Melua's got plenty of time to decide on a persona, and Piece by Piece has enough quality material on it to placate fans until she does, but there's some tension here, and it doesn't sound intentional. Besides, anyone who covers Canned Heat and the Cure on the same record is still trying to figure it all out. \n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Shy Boy\n[02] Nine Million Bicycles\n[03] Piece By Piece\n[04] Halfway Up The Hindu Kush\n[05] Blues In The Night\n[06] Spider's Web\n[07] Blue Shoes\n[08] On The Road Again\n[09] Thank You, Stars\n[10] Just Like Heaven\n[11] I Cried For You\n[12] I Do Believe In Love\n\n\nTotal Play Time\t----&gt; 00h:44m:33s\n\nTotal File Size\t----&gt; 118mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t----&gt; 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t----&gt; I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format----&gt; N / A\n\t\nScanned Artwork\t----&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t----&gt; Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader----&gt; Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t----&gt; 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t----&gt; Blues Jazz Pop\n\nRelease Date\t----&gt; 28 September 2005 [UK] 06 June 2006 [US]\n\nRecord Company\t----&gt;  Dramatico Records\n\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.katiemelua.com \n&gt; http://www.katiemeluausa.com \n&gt;\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Melua\n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/m/melua.html\n&gt; http://www.ilike.com/artist/Katie+Melua \n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.videocure.com/music-videos/k/c9be4f2c26add8f5bf7a738fce2d4ac8.html \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13383ca77075045779684c389a722b2e58384c3c","amp;dn":"%5B2005%5D+Piece+By+Piece+-+Katie+Melua+-+118mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13383ca77075045779684c389a722b2e58384c3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,56,60,167,112,117,4,87,121,104,76,56,154,114,43,46,88,56,76,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
