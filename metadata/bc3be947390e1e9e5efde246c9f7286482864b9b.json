[5 hrs 40 mins]\nA collection of Phryne Fisher short stories\n\nIf you think you would like entertaining audio books about a glamorous young lady private investigator in Melbourne in the late 1920's, then you will like Ms Phryne Fisher.\nIs the heroine rather too perfect, lucky, beautiful and talented - yes of course she is! But, this series is a lot of escapist fun. Be warned that there are even some sex scenes - though tastefully done of course!\n(Those familiar with Melbourne, Australia will recognize many landmarks and places still in existence today).\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc3be947390e1e9e5efde246c9f7286482864b9b","amp;dn":"The+Phryne+Fisher+Mystery+Collection+-+Kerry+Greenwood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc3be947390e1e9e5efde246c9f7286482864b9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,59,233,71,57,14,30,158,94,253,226,70,201,247,40,100,130,134,75,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
