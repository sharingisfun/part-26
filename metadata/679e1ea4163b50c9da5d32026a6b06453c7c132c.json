In '73 Greenslade released &quot;Bedside Manner Are Extra&quot;, in my opinion their masterwork. It's an an excellent blend of classic, jazz, rock, blues and symphonic rock with elaborate compositions and inventive and exciting dual-keyboardplay by Greenslade and Lawson. The omnipresence of the Mellotron is very pleasant with majestic waves of the violin-Mellotron (like early KING CRIMSON) and glorious eruptions of sumptuous choir-Mellotron. In comparison with the 'progrock-dinosaurs' ELP and YES, GREENSLADE played more varied styles, the songs were shorter and it lacked the usual 'progrock self-indulgence' (like ELP and Yes), no endless soloing. Highlight is the splendid build-up track &quot;Drum Folk&quot; featuring halfway a short drumsolo and some Mellotron, the climax is a bluesy, very moving Hammond organ solo, goose bumps! GREENSLADE is a band to discover and they deserve more appreciation by the progrock aficionados\n\n\n1 Bedside Manners Are Extra  6:20 \n2 Pilgrims Progress   7:00 \n3 Time to Dream  4:48 \n4 Drum Folk   8:49 \n5 Sunkissed You're Not   6:32 \n6 Chalkhill \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:679e1ea4163b50c9da5d32026a6b06453c7c132c","amp;dn":"Greenslade...Bedside+Manners+Are+Extra%281973%29re+issue1996%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"679e1ea4163b50c9da5d32026a6b06453c7c132c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,158,30,164,22,59,80,201,218,93,50,2,106,107,6,69,60,124,19,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
