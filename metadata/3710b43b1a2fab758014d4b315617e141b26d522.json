The required files are the recommended open source files. I only packaged this so people can easily download and play right away, instead of manually installing the game. Please seed, as this game is lesser known. Thanks! \n\n\n\n************ GAME DETAILS: ************\nOFFICIAL SHORT:\nOpenTTD is an open source simulation game based upon the popular Microprose game &quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot;, written by Chris Sawyer. It attempts to mimic the original game as closely as possible while extending it with new features.\n\n\nMINE:\nFun small game that allows you to build a transportation empire using trucks, trains, planes, and/or ships. It can be a bit easy, but I find it enjoyable. It is pretty easy to learn. It has MANY options and settings so you can change it to make it easier or harder, if you would like. You can make your own maps too. Its a good version of the classic game. \n\n\n\nSome quick specs:\nMultiplayer up to 255 players\nHUGE maps\nCustomizable settings to make any map you want\nTerraforming and canal construction\nClassic game with &quot;lite&quot; graphics allows use on just about any Mac out there\n25 MB zipped, 45 MB extracted\n\n\n\nSupport for the game and more details is available at http://www.openttd.org/en/\n\nComment with any questions orÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ well, comments. Enjoy!
