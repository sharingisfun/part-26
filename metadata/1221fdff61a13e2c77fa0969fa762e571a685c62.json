The track titled &quot;Henrietta&quot; was unveiled by We All Want Someone To Shout For on Monday May 15, delivered by the band itself to its mailing list.\n\n&quot;Henrietta&quot; keeps in the electronic, danceable direction the band had in their Odd Blood, and is set to be included on the thirdcoming record announced for release later this year. Fans could expect new tracks until band hits the road?!\n\n\nThis is a direct rip from the website of the MP3\n\n\n\nEnjoy !!!\n\nTxmusician","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1221fdff61a13e2c77fa0969fa762e571a685c62","amp;dn":"Yeasayer+-+Henrietta+%5BNEW+SINGLE+2012%5D.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1221fdff61a13e2c77fa0969fa762e571a685c62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,33,253,255,97,161,62,44,119,250,9,105,250,118,46,87,26,104,92,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
