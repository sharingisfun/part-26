The children have a disease which means they cannot be touched by direct sunlight without being hurt in some way. They will live alone there with oppressive, strange and almost religious rules, until she needs to hire a group of servants for them. Their arrival will accidentally begin to break the rules with unexpected consequences.\n\nDirector: Alejandro Amenabar\nWriter: Alejandro Amenabar\nStars: Nicole Kidman, Christopher Eccleston and Fionnula Flanagan\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230600/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230600/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo....: x264 @ 9405kbps \nAudio....: Eng DTS 5.1 1510kbps \nLength...: 104min \nSubs.....: English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:289b6d2050358e973c3936a215b5cea738df9eab","amp;dn":"The.Others.2001.1080p.BluRay.x264-LEVERAGE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"289b6d2050358e973c3936a215b5cea738df9eab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,155,109,32,80,53,142,151,60,57,54,162,21,181,206,167,56,223,158,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
