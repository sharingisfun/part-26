Their best-known members were Lou Reed and John Cale, who both went on to find success as solo artists. Although never commercially successful while together, the band is often cited by many critics as one of the most important and influential groups of their era, and to many future musicians. \nThe Velvet Underground was a part of the subcultural New York City art collective surrounding Andy Warhol's Factory and his Exploding Plastic Inevitable events. The band's music and lyrics challenged conventional societal standards of the time, and broke ground for other musicians to do the same. The band favored experimentation, and also introduced a nihilistic outlook.  Their outsider attitude and experimentation has since been cited as pivotal to the rise of punk rock and, later, alternative rock.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:870e21704d073f02e9c0028b1bd1f51c4522ef4e","amp;dn":"The+Velvet+Underground+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"870e21704d073f02e9c0028b1bd1f51c4522ef4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,14,33,112,77,7,63,2,233,192,2,139,27,209,245,28,69,34,239,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
