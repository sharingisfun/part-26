The battlefields of this conflict are all located in the area of the Holy Roman Empire; therefore the map encompasses the EmpireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dominion and the directly neighboring areas (Copenhagen-Udine / Reims-Riga). A high level of detail is guaranteed through 198 provinces and 24 factions an extensive script adds to the immersion. The pivotal aspect of the mod will be the struggle of the Kaiser with the Counter Reformation; protestant leaders being his main adversaries.\nForeign powers enter the game as spawning factions like SiebenbÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rgen or as invaders like Sweden and France. Poland-Lithuania (the Western areas), Denmark, Swiss Union and the United Netherlands have their part on the map as well, although their influence in the beginning will be more passive. The eighty years war between the Netherlands and Spanish Habsburg will also play a role in the overall war of that period.\n\n\nRecommendation:\nBefore installation of this mod it is advisable to follow this tutorial as from step 3 onward: How To Fix UAC and VirtualStore Problems (http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?t=397636), this will assure that future patches will be applied properly.  \n\nInstallation:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tPlace all downloaded files into one directory\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tRun\\double click 1648 Vollversion Part 1.EXE\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tRun\\double click 1648 Vollversion Part 2.EXE\n\n\nGeneral Information:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tIt is not necessary to run the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDOÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ files ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they are automatically installed.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tShould your install path include ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMyProductÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ browse manually to the main folder of your M2TW installation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ NOT the mods folder!\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tSteam Users please refer to this article for installation: Creating a World - Mod Install for Steam (http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?t=410461)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fff130ff56db4f5bb56a1ce98d7e746ed58470ff","amp;dn":"1648","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fff130ff56db4f5bb56a1ce98d7e746ed58470ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,241,48,255,86,219,79,91,181,106,28,233,141,126,116,110,213,132,112,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
