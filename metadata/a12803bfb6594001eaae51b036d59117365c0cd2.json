Do Pi, The Pythagorean Theorem, and angle calculations just make your head spin? Relax. With Head First 2D Geometry, you'll master everything from triangles, quads and polygons to the time-saving secrets of similar and congruent angles -- and it'll be quick, painless, and fun.\n\nThrough entertaining stories and practical examples from the world around you, this book takes you beyond boring problems. You'll actually use what you learn to make real-life decisions, like using angles and parallel lines to crack a mysterious CSI case. Put geometry to work for you, and nail your class exams along the way.\n\nWe think your time is too valuable to waste struggling with new concepts. Using the latest research in cognitive science and learning theory to craft a multi-sensory learning experience, Head First 2D Geometry uses a visually-rich format designed for the way your brain works, not a text-heavy approach that puts you to sleep.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a12803bfb6594001eaae51b036d59117365c0cd2","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+Head+First+2D+Geometry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a12803bfb6594001eaae51b036d59117365c0cd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,40,3,191,182,89,64,1,234,174,81,176,54,213,145,23,54,92,12,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
