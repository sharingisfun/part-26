Since the beginning IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been amazed at the caliber of artists that have either approached us or agreed to release through us. Liam Stewart is yet another in an amazing roster of artists that are showing listeners that the world of netaudio is not something to ignore. With his incredible Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sixteen WordsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re presented another album that will make some wonder how on Earth is it that it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t released by a traditional label. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the state of the music industryÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ labels are only releasing &quot;marketable&quot; products that they can shove into a pre-packaged formulaic box. If artists want to create ART and speak THEIR voice, then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no room for them. So artists are forced (I feel, for the better of music and artistry in general) to forge their own paths. LiamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s path has led him to blocSonic and I am grateful for the opportunity.\n\nLiamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound is one that is pop of a British flavorÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ you may call it Britpop or leftfield pop or some other quick and neat genre label, but the reality of it is more complex than that. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sixteen WordsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ contains many characteristicsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ pop, rock, electronic &amp; synth-pop. At times it may remind you of Pink Floyd or Roger Waters, Tears For Fears or some current indie-artist that you may dig. Whatever it sounds like to you, what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m quite sure youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find is that this is memorable music thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to stick with you for years to come. It isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t plastic music made for the masses, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contemplative music crafted for music lovers who crave albums that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trying to fit in.\n\nI hope that with the help of this engaging album, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll regard Liam Stewart as an artist youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be eager to hear more from.\n\nThanks for downloading and for listening.
