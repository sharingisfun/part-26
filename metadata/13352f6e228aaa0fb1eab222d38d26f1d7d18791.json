The show is about Alice De Raey, played by Cara Pifko, a young criminal lawyer fresh out of Osgoode Hall Law School, and thrown into a chaotic justice system. She encounters characters ranging from the truly desperate to the bizarre. Alice, with a good-natured openness that cloaks a tenacious, committed spirit, finds herself on a journey that constantly tests her patience and compassion. \n\nThe resolution is 608x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion. \n \nFurther info can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Wonderland and &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.tvrage.com/This_is_Wonderland&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.tvrage.com/This_is_Wonderland&lt;/a&gt; and http://www.ovguide.com/tv/this_is_wonderland.htm \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13352f6e228aaa0fb1eab222d38d26f1d7d18791","amp;dn":"This.Is.Wonderland.S03E02.WS.XviD-err0001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13352f6e228aaa0fb1eab222d38d26f1d7d18791","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,53,47,110,34,138,170,15,177,234,178,34,211,141,38,241,215,209,135,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
