His powers of time and intellect have allowed him to secretly remove certain critical days from the historical record. Their stories have never been told. Their details have never been documented. Their existence is not remembered. But the occurrences of these days have forever changed the course of humanityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s evolution. These are the 'Days Missing' from our existence, and they are about to be revealed...\n\nIn the premiere issue, a deadly new virus threatens to herald an extinction level event if The Steward canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t find a cure for scientists to discover - the day before. From Archaia and Roddenberry Productions, the people behind Star Trek, comes a new science-fiction mini-series that explores a new frontier. Written by Phil Hester and illustrated by Frazer Irving.  Covers provided by Dale Keown, Frazer Irving and Phil Hester.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55ac42b59a4872bfe122a6f90366bb9380191f61","amp;dn":"Days+Missing+%28Archaia+Studios+Press%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55ac42b59a4872bfe122a6f90366bb9380191f61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,172,66,181,154,72,114,191,225,34,166,249,3,102,187,147,128,25,31,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
