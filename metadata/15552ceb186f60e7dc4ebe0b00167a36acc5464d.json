It's all in a day's work for Sookie...\n\nCocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse is on a streak of real bad luck. First, her co-worker gets murdered and no one seems to care. Then Sookie is attacked - and poisoned - late one night by some weird and apparently mythical beast. She only survives because the local vampires roll up and graciously suck the poison from her veins (like they didn't enjoy it). But in return the blood-suckers need a favor.\n\nWhich is why Sookie ends up in Dallas, using her telepathic skills to search for a missing vampire, on the condition that her undead friends don't do anything, well, vampiric while she's there. Easier said than done. All it takes is one delicious blonde and one small mistake for things to turn deadly..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15552ceb186f60e7dc4ebe0b00167a36acc5464d","amp;dn":"Living+dead+in+Dallas+-+Charlaine+Harris-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15552ceb186f60e7dc4ebe0b00167a36acc5464d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,85,44,235,24,111,96,231,220,78,190,11,0,22,122,54,172,197,70,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
