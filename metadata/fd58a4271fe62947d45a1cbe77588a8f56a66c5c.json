She charted major hit records in the 1960s and 1970s, working in idioms ranging from early-'60s girl group-style ballads to Jackie Deshannon folk-influenced pop, to adult contemporary pop in the manner of later Dusty Springfield. She also embarked on an acting career, initially in the late 1960s in association with her work as part of Sonny &amp; Cher but later on her own, which led to a series of increasingly polished and compelling performances in Silkwood, Mask and Moonstruck, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nCherilyn Sarkisian was born in California in 1946; she was 17 when she first met Salvatore &quot;Sonny&quot; Bono, a songwriter and protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© of producer Phil Spector. Bono brought her to Spector, who used her as a backup singer and produced one single by her, a novelty Beatles tribute record called &quot;Ringo I Love You&quot; issued under the name Bonnie Jo Mason. It disappeared without a trace, but the couple were undaunted -- they emerged as a duo, initially called Caesar &amp; Cleo, later that year, and cut &quot;The Letter,&quot; &quot;Do You Wanna Dance&quot; and &quot;Love Is Strange.&quot; ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:difixqw5ldfe~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:difixqw5ldfe~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nThis greatest-hits collection was released at a time when Cher was enjoying a massive musical comeback with her hit song and album Believe. Cher is one of those artists who, like Diana Ross, seems to have countless greatest-hits collections, both in the U.S. and abroad. This set offers one previously unreleased song, &quot;Don't Come Cryin' to Me,&quot; written by Diane Warren, and the focus is mainly on the hits from her Geffen era, between 1987 and 1992. This album features her '80s comeback hit &quot;I Found Someone,&quot; the massive &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time,&quot; and her duet with Peter Cetera, &quot;After All.&quot; Other notables include her hit from the Mermaids soundtrack, &quot;The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)&quot; (which was a number one hit overseas), and the single remix of &quot;Heart of Stone.&quot; To touch on her '70s hits, this album includes her three signature &quot;story songs,&quot; &quot;Half-Breed,&quot; &quot;Dark Lady,&quot; and &quot;Gypsies, Tramps &amp; Thieves,&quot; as well as two other Top Ten hits, 1972's &quot;The Way of Love&quot; and 1979's disco hit &quot;Take Me Home.&quot; For good measure, &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; closes out the album. This collection touches upon different eras of Cher's recording career, with emphasis on the Geffen years, but is by no means all-inclusive, and certainly doesn't touch on any of her hits from Believe, or even her last Geffen hit, &quot;One By One.&quot; One would need a box set to collect all those songs.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gjfrxqujldke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gjfrxqujldke&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThere are lots of reviews at Amazon: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WOXQEG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000WOXQEG&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
