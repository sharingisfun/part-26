IT HAS BEEN PORTED FROM PC. IT IS NOT 100% FUNCTIONAL. IT'S BUGGY, IT FREEZES, AND OCCASIONALLY CORRUPTS SAVES. USE AT OWN RISK.\n\nNow with that out of the way, here's the skinny. I have spent the last two weeks working with the PC DLC for Skyrim, bringing it over to PS3. Does it work? Yes! Does it work well? No! However at the moment, both DLCs together are stable enough to allow ps3 owners to play a good chunk of the DLCs. This is the first release I was comfortable sharing with other users. \n\nVideos of both DLCs in action on a PS3:\nDawnguard PS3\nHearthfire PS3\n\nFrom the README.TXT:\n\nHi. This is the Skyrim DLC on ps3.\n\nI did this because BESHITTA wouldn't. \nThey have been sitting on their hands for way too long.\n\nThis is both the Dawnguard and Hearthfire DLCs. They are BOTH experimental, \nBOTH unofficial, and BOTH buggy. I have noticed a number of bugs, but here \nare the big ones:\n\nDawnguard quest will crap out when entering the cave southeast of Riften. \nI don't know what causes it, but it just loads forever and goes nowhere. \nSo Fort Dawnguard and other new locations are inaccessible. However\nthe majority of new map locations are functional, minus the odd debug\ninformation some areas have.\n\nSome creatures do not move. This includes but not limited to: Large mantis\ncreatures, hell hounds, wolves, foxes, and the Falmer. Sadly the fucking bears\nwork just fine.\n\nThe audio for any Dawnguard or Hearthfire dialouge does not play. Turn subtiles\non if you want to know what's going on.\n\nCrossbows will crash the game. However dragon weapons work just fine. (Must\nhave dragon smithing perk)\n\nOccasionally a master vampire will appear at night in Whiterun and crash the\ngame when they attack the player.\n\nSome areas in Hearthfire have graphical glitches, and glass weapon cases\nwill not function correctly.\n\nExpect crashes, infinite loading screens, glitched characters, and other irritations.\n\nEnjoy, and please note and comment any other bugs or irritations you find.\nI'll keep a record in case I find someone who can fix them, or if I learn to myself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:252fa38026e90322e678f3a514b213da00c5245b","amp;dn":"Skyrim+Dawnguard+%26amp%3B+Hearthfire+DLC+%28Unofficial%2C+buggy+WIP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"252fa38026e90322e678f3a514b213da00c5245b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,47,163,128,38,233,3,34,230,120,243,165,20,178,19,218,0,197,36,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
