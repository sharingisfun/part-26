They discuss people's reaction to racial humor, comic lives and dying too young, we see an old clip of a Bill Burr interview and hear from new sponsor ADailyMinute.com. Ant talks about drinking on-air back in the day, Jim talks about his recent appearances on O&amp;J and his Ozzy's Boneyard show, and they muse over new music and dating younger girls. After a few calls, Ant explains his theory on relationships, they go through a red flag list when it comes to crazy girls, Florentine tells us some stories about when he was roommates with Jim Norton, they swap stories about bed hopping chicks, and a bonus time phone call is made to Bobo's mom regarding his booking on the show tomorrow","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:792bd2d2fddc0debd71c2ab3289d5de1f80ea47e","amp;dn":"2014-10-21.The+Anthony+Cumia+Show","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"792bd2d2fddc0debd71c2ab3289d5de1f80ea47e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,43,210,210,253,220,13,235,215,28,42,179,40,157,93,225,248,14,164,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
