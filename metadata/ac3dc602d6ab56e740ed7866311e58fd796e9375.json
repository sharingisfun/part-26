This in turn makes your system not boot up due to you\noverwriting or renaming a much needed file.\n\nNot only that! But you also need it in CD/DVD format so that\nyour new fancy laptop that DOESN&amp;#039;T have a non-USB floppy\ndrive can boot up properly.\n\n(If you can&amp;#039;t tell, this is from personal experience)\n\nWell look no further!\n\nI noticed that someone (bootdisk.com) was asking $4 for\nthis software package that was initially FREE in the first \nplace, but only converted over to a CD. Granted that this $4\nincluded other softwares. Feeling that this was lame, and \nif something is FREE then it should be FREE no matter what \nformat it is in.\n\nI did the work becuase I needed this package. And I share my\npersonal work (all of 20 minutes) with you folk. You may be \nmore experienced then myself and not wanted to bother or less \nexperienced and in desperate need. So this will help all of us.\n\nWhat is included:\n-ISO of NTFS4DOS filesystem that is to be burned to a CD using\n UltraISO. (UltraISO is the only one that I found to be stable\n through the process)\n-BIF (bootimage file) that is also used in UltraISO to map the\n bootable portion of the CD _IF_ the ISO doesn&amp;#039;t contain it.\n (I only tried with the BIF AND ISO, not just the ISO, I only \n  needed one CD. So why try many times?)\n-ntfs_h.exe - This is the freeware downloaded software from \n Avira (http://www.free-av.com/) that was used to create the \n original boot floppy that  was later turned into the ISO image \n for CD. If you JUST need a floppy diskette, then this is really \n all you need.\n\n Have fun and remember to share little kiddies...\n\nInstructions:\n\n-Simply use the ISO in UltraISO (the only one i found to be stable \n through this process) to open the image.\n-Load the BIF as the boot file (Bootable &gt; Load Boot File...)\n-Burn...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac3dc602d6ab56e740ed7866311e58fd796e9375","amp;dn":"NTFS4DOS+Bootable+CD+ISO+Image+%28Updated%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac3dc602d6ab56e740ed7866311e58fd796e9375","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,61,198,2,214,171,86,231,64,237,120,102,49,30,88,253,121,110,147,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
