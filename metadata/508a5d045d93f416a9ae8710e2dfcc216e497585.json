ArchiCADÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s end-to-end BIM workflow allows the model to stay live till the very end of the project.\n- Structurally Correct Details out of the Box\n\nPriority Based Connections, together with Intelligent Building Materials, automatically provide structurally correct sections and details.\n\n- Large/Complex Models to Stay Responsive\n\nTo further enhance productivity, ArchiCAD 17 takes the next revolutionary step in multi-core processing to support the creation and manipulation of large complex models with industry-first Background Processing Support for faster generation of complex model details.\n\n- OPEN BIM to Support National Standards\n\nArchiCAD 17 supports Coordination View 2.0 and expands capabilities for defining new data required by the Concept Design BIM 2010 (GSA (US), Statsbygg (Norway), Senate Properties (Finland)), the Basic FM Handover (COBie documentation) and other IFC standards. This includes IFC System and IFC Time Series Schedule assignments, assignments with multilevel (Ã¢â‚¬ËœsubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) hierarchy, special base quantities, editable IFC Type Product entities, Site context elements etc.\n\n- Open Interface to External BIM Component Providers\n\nDirect access to an extensive collection of Manufacturer Content on BIMobject.com offers users a comprehensive range of intelligent BIM components available both in ArchiCAD 17 and on BIMcomponents.com.\n\n- Integrated Design, Visualization and Analysis Workflow\n\nImproved MORPH Tool and Real-time 3D Cutting Planes give extra control of ArchiCADÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 3D modeling environment. Inclusion of fully functional BIMx in every installation enables users to share BIM projects with their clients in the form of interactive BIM project environments; further improved Energy Evaluation supporting multiple thermal zones allows users to evaluate their designs with standard compliant technology.\n\nRequirements\n_http://www.graphisoft.com/support/system_requirements/ - See more at: http://torrentbaza.com/download_software/154699-archicad-17-hotfix-2-b4005-mac-os-x.html#sthash.AyIZxDrv.dpuf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:508a5d045d93f416a9ae8710e2dfcc216e497585","amp;dn":"AC.17.Build.3002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"508a5d045d93f416a9ae8710e2dfcc216e497585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,138,93,4,93,147,244,22,169,174,135,16,226,223,204,33,110,73,117,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
