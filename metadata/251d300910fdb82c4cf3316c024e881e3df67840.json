The world of Battle Fantasia was once shrouded in darkness. Mankind made six valiant attempts to defeat the darkness, but each battle was lost. It took the courage of four mighty heroes to restore light to the world. With peace restored, two kingdoms were established, the Steam Empire and Magic Kingdom. With the darkness rumored to be making a return, a group of powerful warriors from around the world has gathered to make a stand for mankind. Choose from 12 beautifully illustrated characters who do battle in equally stunning 3D environments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:251d300910fdb82c4cf3316c024e881e3df67840","amp;dn":"Battle+Fantasia+NTSC%2FU+NTSC%2FJ+Xbox+360+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"251d300910fdb82c4cf3316c024e881e3df67840","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,29,48,9,16,253,184,44,76,243,49,108,2,78,136,30,61,246,120,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
