They visit Steeple Bumpleigh, home of Bertie's Uncle Percy, also the home of Bertie's ex-fiancÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½e, Florence, and her new fiancÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, Constable Stilton Cheesewright. In addition, Bertie's cousin, Nobby, wants Bertie's help in gaining Uncle Percy's approval of her writer fiancÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½. To complicate the romantic antics, Stilton thinks Bertie wants to reconcile with Florence (as does Florence) and threatens bodily harm. Into the muddle comes Jeeves, who, as always, saves the day. It's hard to improve on this treasure, but Jonathan Cecil does it with an impeccable, wildly funny narration.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63685d5832a54599bca9e963044a14b2d6b71b7c","amp;dn":"Jeeves+in+the+Morning+-+P.+G.+Wodehouse+++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63685d5832a54599bca9e963044a14b2d6b71b7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,104,93,88,50,165,69,153,188,169,233,99,4,74,20,178,214,183,27,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
