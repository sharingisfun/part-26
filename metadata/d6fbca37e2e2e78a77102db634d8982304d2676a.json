The Monkees were talented singers, musicians, and songwriters who made a handful of the finest pop singles of their day (as well as a few first-rate albums) and delivered exciting, entertaining live shows. But at a time when rock music was becoming more self-conscious and &quot;serious,&quot; the hipper echelons of the music press often lambasted the Monkees, largely because they didn't come together organically but through the casting process for a television series, and they initially didn't write the bulk of their own material or play all the instruments on their records. The fact they later took creative control of their music was often overlooked, and the quality of their music, which featured the work of some of the finest session players and songwriters of the 1960s, often seemed to be beside the point. Time has ultimately vindicated the Monkees, and their music still sounds fresh and engaging decades after it was recorded, but in some circles they never fully shook being branded as &quot;the Pre-Fab Four,&quot; no matter how far they moved from the circumstances that brought them together.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-monkees-p4940/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-monkees-p4940/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Roch Parisien):\n\nBy 1969's Instant Replay, it was all over but the funeral. Peter Tork had already left the fold and the songs were little more than disjointed solo vehicles for the remaining three, combined with older unreleased tracks from the vaults. This afforded far too much rope for schmaltzy Jones ballads, although Nesmith salvages the day once again with tasty country inflections on the wistful &quot;Don't Wait for Me&quot; and &quot;While I Cry.&quot; This otherwise slight collection -- for intensive Monkees fans only -- is at least beefed up by some interesting previously unreleased songs, rather than just alternate mixes.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/instant-replay-r13307&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/instant-replay-r13307&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000033E7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000033E7&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
