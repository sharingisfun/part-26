But when they meet, and sparks fly, she discovers the soul mate she never dreamed would come her way. Walter Ã¢â‚¬Å“DutchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Harber, the gorgeous bachelor president, has his hands full with a combative Congress and an upcoming reelection bid. But when he meets Gina, this voluptuous black woman with all the right curves, he finds in her a strong, independent equal who keeps him intellectually-challenged publicly and sexually-energized privately, so much so that he becomes convinced that he has finally met the love of his life. But Washington politics wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give this interracial couple an easy ride, as they must battle forces from within and forces from without that seek to tear down everything they have fought so hard to build up. And just when they thought they had endured every knockout punch imaginable, another curve is tossed their way with the kind of implications, the kind of jarring reality, that can not only destroy a love affair, but can bring down an entire presidency.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:702489b405c74138e82b60915891b0b22c65f55f","amp;dn":"The+President%27s+Girlfriend+by+Mallory+Monroe+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"702489b405c74138e82b60915891b0b22c65f55f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,36,137,180,5,199,65,56,232,43,96,145,88,145,176,178,44,101,245,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
