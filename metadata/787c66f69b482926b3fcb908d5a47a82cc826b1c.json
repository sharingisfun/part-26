The huge scale of the film (the photography is stunning throughout) has been criticised by some as dwarfing the characters, but Lean always uses nature to good effect, and the acting is strong enough to stand out.  It won two oscars, one for cinematography and one for John Mill's portrayal of the village idiot.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:787c66f69b482926b3fcb908d5a47a82cc826b1c","amp;dn":"Ryan%27s+Daughter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"787c66f69b482926b3fcb908d5a47a82cc826b1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,124,102,246,155,72,41,38,179,252,185,8,213,164,122,130,204,130,107,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
