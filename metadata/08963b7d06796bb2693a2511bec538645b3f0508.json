STEVE ZAHN,PAUL WALKER,LEELEE SOBIESKI,TED LEVINE ....\n\n\nPLOT:\n\n\nLewis Thomas (Paul Walker), decides to go cross-country to pick up his high school sweetheart, Venna Wilcox (Leelee Sobieski), from college. On his way there, he bails his brother, Fuller Thomas (Steve Zahn), out of jail. Fuller, looking for a good time, decides to ride with Lewis. During their trip to pick up Venna, Fuller coaxes Lewis into playing a cruel joke, through their CB radio, on a truck driver, known only as 'Rusty Nail' (voiced by Ted Levine). When the joke takes a deadly turn, Lewis, Venna, and Fuller find themselves being relentlessly stalked by the psychotic truck driver who is looking for more than an apology.\n\n\nTAGLINE:\n\n\nIt started as a joke. Now the joke is on them. Don't screw with people you don't know. Don't play with strangers. Everything you say will come back to haunt you. Everything you see will terrify you. And everything you hear will drive you over the edge.\n\n\n\n** Using Handbrake, I ripped this from the full 6GB DVD-9 torrent to save everyone else the 3-4 days it takes to download that torrent, and to save them about 5GB of space.  The XviD torrent uploaded by Greenbud1969 is what you'd expect for a medium bitrate XviD file but it's definitely not DVD quality, and the only other torrent has hard coded Swedish subtitles.  The video in this torrent is DVD quality and the 5.1 AC3 was passed through untouched from the original DVD-9.  \n\nEnjoy and PLEASE SEED!!  I'm only doing this to help others and I'm not going to be seeding this for very long, so if nobody else seeds it it's going to die and people will be left with the same lousy options I had. **\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08963b7d06796bb2693a2511bec538645b3f0508","amp;dn":"Joy+Ride+%282001%29+-+AVC+%2F+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08963b7d06796bb2693a2511bec538645b3f0508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,150,59,125,6,121,107,178,105,58,37,17,190,197,56,100,91,63,5,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
