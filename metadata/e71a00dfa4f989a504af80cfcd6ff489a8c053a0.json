Published in 2005, it is based upon Johnson's theory that popular culture Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in particular television programs and video games Ã¢â‚¬â€œ has grown more complex and demanding over time and is improving the society within terms of intelligence and idea. The book's claims, especially related to the proposed benefits of television, drew media attention.[1] It received mixed critical reviews.\n\nJohnson states that the goal of his book is to persuade readers &quot;that popular culture has, on average, grown more complex and intellectually challenging over the past thirty years.&quot;[2]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e71a00dfa4f989a504af80cfcd6ff489a8c053a0","amp;dn":"Everything+Bad+Is+Good+For+You+-+Steven+Johnson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e71a00dfa4f989a504af80cfcd6ff489a8c053a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,26,0,223,164,249,137,165,4,175,128,207,205,111,244,137,168,192,83,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
