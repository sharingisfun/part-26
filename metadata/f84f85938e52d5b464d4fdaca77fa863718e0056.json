The California native then parlayed his theater background into a multi-month run on American Idol in 2009. Lambert's flair for neo-goth clothing and eclectic arrangements made him a critical favorite, as did his dramatic tenor vocals. Following performances of Led Zeppelin's &quot;Whole Lotta Love,&quot; Tears for Fears' &quot;Mad World,&quot; and Johnny Cash's &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; Lambert found himself pitted against Kris Allen in the grand finale, which he ultimately lost by a slim margin. Lambert was unanimously praised by the American Idol judges, however, who all but guaranteed him a successful recording career following the show's conclusion. \n\n\nGenre................: Pop\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Warner Bros.\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, auCDtect, Cue\n\n\n\n01.Ghost Town\n02.The Original High\n03.Another Lonely Night\n04.Underground\n05.There I Said It\n06.Rumors (Feat.
