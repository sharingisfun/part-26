However this is not very Handy. Creating playlists take time and come along the month. This month I had a little catching up to do so that did not fit to nicely. So the first eight playlists of November may contain some outdated tracks (but sound awfully well).\n\nTo make it easier I decided to release the lists one by one. The parts have a continuous number to check completeness. @1 in front of the playlist title still means Easy listening, @2 Rocky and @3 Alternative.\n\n\nDutch Treat - Indie Playlist 1111-05 - @3 Wires\n\n01 - Finding Reasons (New Build) \n02 - Groovy Train (Farm) \n03 - Empty Hand (Eliza Doolittle) \n04 - Rule My World (Kings Of Convenience) \n05 - There She Goes (Las) \n06 - Shake Me Down (Cage The Elephant) \n07 - Shoot The Water (Austra) \n08 - Through A Fogged Glass (Wes Swing) \n09 - The Summer (Yo La Tengo) \n10 - Can We Really Party Today (Jonathan Wilson) \n11 - Apple Pie Bed (Lawrence Arabia) \n12 - Champagne Coast (Blood Orange) \n13 - Creature Makers (Solarsolar) \n14 - Skipping A Beat (I'm From Barcelona) \n15 - Whatever Leads Me To You (Geoffrey O'connor) \n16 - Wires (Athlete) \n17 - Changes (Twin Shadow) \n18 - Under The Sun (Vhs Or Beta) \n19 - Acid Rain (Saintseneca) \n20 - Some Children (Holy Ghost!) \n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e47e5cea097bf71473e3373b8e36c290c85b9144","amp;dn":"Indie+Playlists+1111+%2305+-+Wires+%28Dutch+Treat+HQ+MP3+VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e47e5cea097bf71473e3373b8e36c290c85b9144","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,126,92,234,9,123,247,20,115,227,55,59,142,54,194,144,200,91,145,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
