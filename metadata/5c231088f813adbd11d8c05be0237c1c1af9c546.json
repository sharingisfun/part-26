After all, sheâ€™s only seventeen and looking for a better way to make money than babysitting. She buys a self-help book that promises to teach her how to write a self-help book in the hope of getting the job done. \r\nNot that itâ€™ll be easy to get any work done this holiday season. Her family is staying at the house for Christmas, and fights break out almost immediately. Dani also has to deal with the fallout from an unexpected kiss with her best friend Seth and the feelings that go along with it. On edge around her family and unsure how to interact with the one person sheâ€™s trusted with everything in the past, she can only take what inspiration she can from the crazy circumstances surrounding her and see what happens. \r\nOne way or another, it should be an interesting holiday.\r\n\r\nTorrent includes: mobi, epub, and pdf.\r\n\r\nFile List:\r\nTitle.jpg\r\nDescription.rtf\r\nIf you like the book please help support the author by sharing her work.rtf\r\nself-help-101-or-how-i-learned-to-take-over-the-world-throug.epub\r\nself-help-101-or-how-i-learned-to-take-over-the-world-throug.mobi\r\nself-help-101-or-how-i-learned-to-take-over-the-world-throug.pdf\r\n\r\nAmazon Link:\r\n\r\nGood Reads Link: \nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27243175-self-help-101-or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you like the book please help support the author by sharing her work.\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14106892.L_G_Keltner","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c231088f813adbd11d8c05be0237c1c1af9c546","amp;dn":"Self-Help+101+or%3A+How+I+Learned+to+Take+Over+the+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c231088f813adbd11d8c05be0237c1c1af9c546","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,35,16,136,248,19,173,189,17,216,192,91,224,35,124,28,26,249,197,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
