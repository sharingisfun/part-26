Meet the patients in Dr. Burton's Wednesday-afternoon support group: Violet carries a jar full of demons. Roger can read minds. Akiko talks with her dead parents through the bathroom mirror. Joe is an exorcist. Brian is pyrokinetic. And then, of course, there's Charles. They've been thrown together by the luck of the draw, stuck with supernatural powers they don't want and can't control. But when something begins to pick them off one by one, the surviving members of the Wednesday Conspiracy find themselves the last, reluctant line of defense between the reincarnation of an ancient evil and the fate of the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:651d7a2ac679014daa8aff2464b027be5e664337","amp;dn":"The+Wednesday+Conspiracy+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"651d7a2ac679014daa8aff2464b027be5e664337","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,29,122,42,198,121,1,77,170,138,255,36,100,176,39,190,94,102,67,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
