Starting as a weekly in the mid-1920s, the magazine is now published 47 times per year, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. Although its reviews and events listings often focus on cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker has a wide audience outside of New York and USA. It is well known in its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric Americana; its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews; its rigorous fact checking and copyediting; its journalism on world politics and social issues; and its famous, single-panel cartoons sprinkled throughout each issue.\n\n\n\nENJOY and SEED !\n\n\nEDGE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:222d4d6a7c95e80823668b03d139e8e868c054b8","amp;dn":"The+New+Yorker+-+September+03%2C+2012+%5BEDGE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"222d4d6a7c95e80823668b03d139e8e868c054b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,45,77,106,124,149,232,8,35,102,139,3,209,57,232,232,104,192,84,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
