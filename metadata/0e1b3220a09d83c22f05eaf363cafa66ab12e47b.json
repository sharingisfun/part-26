A wide variety of evidence from different countries supports the conclusion that open and distance learning has the potential to provide equal opportunities in higher and continuing education and that these are currently being missed. The author provides conclusive evidence that distance education, while involving a degree of risk to the stability of families and relationships, etc., nevertheless offers women a chance which, on balance, is worth taking.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e1b3220a09d83c22f05eaf363cafa66ab12e47b","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2000%5D+Women+and+Distance+Education+Challenges+and+Opportu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e1b3220a09d83c22f05eaf363cafa66ab12e47b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,27,50,32,160,157,131,194,47,5,234,243,99,202,250,102,171,18,228,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
