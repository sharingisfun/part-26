Also from Tong &amp; Rogers is their edit of the Pachanga BoysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ epic Time, again a version which was created especially for this compilation.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The series is constantly evolving; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now slower, funkier and has more vocals than ever beforeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Tong of his latest mix. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I love the art of the mix CD and have a huge respect for the industry, so every time I commit to one IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m trying to make a timeless statement; something that accurately reflects the current musical landscape and will stand the test of time.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThrough his pioneering solo work and as one third of Magnetic Man, Skream's name may have become synonymous with dubstep, but recently the Croydon-born producer has been expanding his aural field to include house and garage-tinged beats and melodies. &quot;I've come so far from where I was before but then I've never really been in one placeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Skream of the shift. Ã¢â‚¬Å“House, techno, disco...this is the music that I'm pushing and loving now. Things needed to evolve and I couldn't be happier.&quot;\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Skream has a love of dark, twisted house music which heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been cultivating through his radio showÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Tong of his Radio 1 cohort. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We wanted to make a fresh statement with this compilation.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSkreamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mix starts deep in the darkness, with the sounds of Phreek Plus One and Maelstrom setting a menacing early tone before the focus switches to bass-heavy productions from Midland and Duke Dumont.  Later in the mix youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find DuskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exceptional re-working of Justin MartinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Go as well as brand new tracks from Skream himself, Rollercoaster feat. Sam Frank.\n\n&quot;This mix is only the start really; it's where I'm heading and I'm really excited about it. There's a lot of variety and plenty of surprises. The b-lines are still there but here is a Skream mix exploring different tempos and styles, and delivering plenty of feeling. I'm really pleased with it; I just hope everyone else loves it as much as I do.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nUltimately, All Gone Pete Tong &amp; Skream Miami 2013 delivers on every level, rendering itself as a rich, unrestricted musical soundscape from two of the sceneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true greats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0fb274e67bc3a285931602f40e41ed29799b89b","amp;dn":"All+Gone+Pete+Tong+%26amp%3B+Skream+Miami+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0fb274e67bc3a285931602f40e41ed29799b89b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,251,39,78,103,188,58,40,89,49,96,47,64,228,30,210,151,153,184,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
