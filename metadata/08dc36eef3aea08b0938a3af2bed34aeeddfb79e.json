His wealth and power, however, do not give him contentment, and his boundless ambition only brings suffering, until he gives everything away, including himself, in the name of love. This epic tale, based on Varvakis' real life, moves from the Greek island of Psara to the court of Catherine the Great in Russia and the shores of the Caspian Sea, and then back to Greece, a country torn by civil war and the fight for independence, during the Revolution of 1821 against the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\nRip from UK DVD The Pirate - CLEAN VERSION NO GREEK SUBTITLES","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08dc36eef3aea08b0938a3af2bed34aeeddfb79e","amp;dn":"God+Loves+Caviar+aka+The+Pirate+-+O+Theos+agapaei+to+haviari+%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08dc36eef3aea08b0938a3af2bed34aeeddfb79e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,220,54,238,243,174,160,139,9,56,163,175,43,237,52,174,237,223,183,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
