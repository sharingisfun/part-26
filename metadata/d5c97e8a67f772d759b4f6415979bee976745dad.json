Not knowing who they are and the plans they have in store for her when Fiona encounters its other inhabitants, she naturally becomes frightened and the control pad mimics the pounding of her heart. Fiona will also become much more difficult to control and will stumble and fall. To add to the experience, FionaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fear is also represented graphically with colour fading from the screen to be replaced by stark monochrome. By running away or hiding, FionaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart rate and actions will return to normal and colour will be restored.\n\nFiona is aided in her search for answers by Hewie, an Alsatian dog, which she befriends by releasing from a trap. Just as in real life Hewie does not at first obey all of the commands Fiona gives him, but as his trust for his new mistress grows so does his willingness to do as she bids including fetching objects and even attacking assailants. The success of this partnership is crucial if Fiona is to solve the castleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mysteries and stay alive.\n\n    * Compelling storyline which is unveiled to the player as Fiona makes her own realisations about her past and future.\n    * Highly innovative representation of the characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s state of mind\n    * Ability to give Hewie orders such as stay, fetch and attack\n    * Cut scenes directed by Naoto Takenaka\n    \n\nFiona Belli es una joven de 18 aÃƒÂ±os que despierta prisionera en una jaula tras perder a sus padres en un accidente de coche. Ã‚Â¿DÃƒÂ³nde se encuentra? Ã‚Â¿CÃƒÂ³mo ha llegado allÃƒÂ­? Y lo que es mÃƒÂ¡s importante: Ã‚Â¿cÃƒÂ³mo escapar? Haunting Ground te invita a resolver esos y otros interrogantes bajo un formato que Capcom conoce muy bien: el survival horror.\n\nHaunting Ground se presenta como el sucesor de Resident Evil. La ambientaciÃƒÂ³n es simplemente tetrica, maravillosamente recreada en forma de un aterrador castillo en el que seremos perseguidos hasta la extenuaciÃƒÂ³n. Nuestra hermosa heroÃƒÂ­na contarÃƒÂ¡ ademÃƒÂ¡s con la ayuda de un compaÃƒÂ±ero especial, un perro que le ayudarÃƒÂ¡ a despistar a su enemigo, y con el que establecerÃƒÂ¡ una especial relaciÃƒÂ³n. Sin duda una de las sorpresas de este aÃƒÂ±o para PS2.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5c97e8a67f772d759b4f6415979bee976745dad","amp;dn":"Haunting+Ground+%5BPS2%5D%5BPAL%5D%5BMulti5-Sp-En-It-Fr-De%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5c97e8a67f772d759b4f6415979bee976745dad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,201,126,138,103,247,114,215,89,180,246,65,89,121,190,233,118,116,93,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
