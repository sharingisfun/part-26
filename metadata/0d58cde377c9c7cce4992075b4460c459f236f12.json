The torrent all but swept away the conservative order that had kept peace on the continent since NapoleonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s defeat at Waterloo in 1815Ã¢â‚¬â€but which in many countries had also suppressed dreams of national freedom. Political events so dramatic had not been seen in Europe since the French Revolution, and they would not be witnessed again until 1989, with the revolutions in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nIn 1848, historian Mike Rapport examines the roots of the ferment and then, with breathtaking pace, chronicles the explosive spread of violence across Europe. A vivid narrative of a complex chain of interconnected revolutions, 1848 tells the exhilarating story of EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s violent Ã¢â‚¬Å“Spring of NationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and traces its reverberations to the present day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d58cde377c9c7cce4992075b4460c459f236f12","amp;dn":"Rapport%2C+Mike+-+1848_Year+of+Revolution.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d58cde377c9c7cce4992075b4460c459f236f12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,88,205,227,119,201,199,204,228,153,32,117,180,70,12,69,159,35,111,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
