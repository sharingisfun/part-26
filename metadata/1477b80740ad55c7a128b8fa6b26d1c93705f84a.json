The Property Brothers come to the rescue and help the couple find a budget-friendly dream home that can be renovated on time. With a budget that doesn't match the couple's expectations, Drew and Jonathan struggle to sell the potential of a fixer-upper. The couple has to decide between two big renovation projects, but for both homes the brothers need to design a kosher kitchen with room for two of every appliance and entertaining space for the Jewish holidays. The couple makes their decision but instantly Jonathan exposes ducting work that threatens his design. And once Liat and Zack learn that he keeps a contingency budget, they start to make surprise design demands. The Brothers struggle to get the situation under control before \nbudget and timeline go completely off course.\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1477b80740ad55c7a128b8fa6b26d1c93705f84a","amp;dn":"My.Dream.Home.s02e09.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1477b80740ad55c7a128b8fa6b26d1c93705f84a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,119,184,7,64,173,85,199,161,40,184,250,107,38,209,201,55,5,248,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
