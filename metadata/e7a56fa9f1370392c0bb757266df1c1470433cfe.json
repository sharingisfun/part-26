RegÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adventure is tempered by original and thought-provoking ruminations on the southern issues of race, pride and identity. A beautiful, original and hot evocation of the cradle of American music.\n\nEpisode 2 of 3: Alabama and Georgia\n\nIn the second of a three-part road trip, Georgia-born but London-based Reginald D Hunter heads home to explore the interplay between gospel, soul and hip hop.
