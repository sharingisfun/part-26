This is what put Metallica into the mainstream, and it is indeed a masterpeice. Every song on this on is a classic. The talent is all there. The production is crystal clear. Everything about this album is epic. A lot of people complain that this is all a little too mainstream, but I disagree. I believe the boys to be in top performance, just because it's a little more accessible, doesn't mean that the talent is gone. Kirk plays some of his greatest solos on this album. I believe that everyone is in top form. Jason Newsted also gets a chance to prove himself on this one. As a bassist, I believe his basslines on the slower songs to showcase his talent the most. He packs a lot of emotion, especially in Nothing Else Matters. Overall, this is just a fun and enjoyable cd with talented musicians and songwriting. Highly recommended! \n\nby Rebecca Lyle\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Enter Sandman.wma                                      \n02 - Sad But True.wma                                       \n03 - Holier Than Thou.wma                                   \n04 - The Unforgiven.wma                                     \n05 - Wherever I May Roam.wma                                \n06 - Don't Tread On Me.wma                                  \n07 - Through The Never.wma                                  \n08 - Nothing Else Matters.wma                               \n09 - Of Wolf And Man.wma                                    \n10 - The God That Failed.wma                                \n11 - My Friend Of Misery.wma                                \n12 - The Struggle Within.wma                                \n13 - So What.wma    \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b97850b4821c5e28e9be2fb2dd99ee31903f505","amp;dn":"Metallica+-+Metallica+%281991%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b97850b4821c5e28e9be2fb2dd99ee31903f505","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,151,133,11,72,33,197,226,142,155,226,251,45,217,158,227,25,3,245,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
