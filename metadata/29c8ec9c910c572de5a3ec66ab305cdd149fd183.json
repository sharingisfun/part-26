Richard E Grant wants to know why the book he loved as a child still has such a hold on our imagination. He travels to Paris to discover how the stories of Sinbad, Ali Baba and Aladdin were first brought to the West by the pioneering Arabist Antoine Galland in the early 18th century. The Nights became an overnight literary sensation and were translated into all the major European languages. In Cairo, Richard explores the medieval Islamic world which first created them and finds that some of the stories are still controversial because of their sexually-explicit content. Richard meets the Egyptian writer Gamal al Ghitani, who received death threats when he published a new edition of the book, and finds that the ribald and riotous stories in the Nights represent a very different view of Islam than fundamentalism.\n\nBBC Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b010jt2h&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b010jt2h&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1400 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio Bitrate: 96 Kbps VBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 633 MB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: PDTV\n\nSRT available from MVGroup","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29c8ec9c910c572de5a3ec66ab305cdd149fd183","amp;dn":"BBC+Secrets+of+the+Arabian+Nights+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29c8ec9c910c572de5a3ec66ab305cdd149fd183","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,200,236,156,145,12,87,45,229,163,236,102,171,48,92,221,20,159,209,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
