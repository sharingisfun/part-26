Doctors see evidence of a recent birth, but before they can act, Roberts disappears. Dispatched to the address she gave at the hospital, police discover bloody towels outside in a Dumpster. Fearing the worst, they call Temperance Brennan to investigate.\nIn a run-down apartment Tempe makes a ghastly discovery: the decomposing bodies of three infants. According to the landlord, a woman named Alma Rogers lives there. Then a man shows up looking for Alva Rodriguez. Are Amy Roberts, Alma Rogers, and Alva Rodriguez the same person? Did she kill her own babies? And where is she now?\nHeading up the investigation is TempeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old flame, homicide detective Andrew Ryan. His counterpart from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is sergeant Ollie Hasty, who happens to have a little history with Tempe himself, which she regrets. This unlikely trio follows the womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trail, first to Edmonton and then to Yellowknife, a remote diamond-mining city deep in the Northwest Territories. What they find in Yellowknife is more sinister than they ever could have imagined. \n\n                              Format 1 - Epub\n\n                              Format 2 - Mobi\n\n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe3dc383c879a8a6190600ed7066baad2bbfec23","amp;dn":"Bones+are+Forever+by+Kathy+Reichs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe3dc383c879a8a6190600ed7066baad2bbfec23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,61,195,131,200,121,168,166,25,6,0,237,112,102,186,173,43,191,236,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
