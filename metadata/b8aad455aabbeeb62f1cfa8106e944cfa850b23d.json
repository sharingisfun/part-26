She's hoping for a more fulfilling life as a sea glass artist, but instead is babysitting her sister's kids and sharing overnights with Noah, her sexy artist boyfriend with commitment issues and a dog Ginger's cat isn't too crazy about. \n\nGeri, her BlackBerry-obsessed sister, is also nearly over the deep end about her pending fiftieth birthday (and might just drag Ginger with her). Toss in a dumpster-picking father, a Kama Sutra T-shirt-wearing mother, a movie crew come to town with a very cute gaffer, an on-again-off-again glassblower boyfriend, plus a couple of Red Hat realtors, and hilarity ensues. The perfect summer read, Life's a Beach is a warm, witty, and wise look at what it takes to move forward at any stage in life.\n\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8aad455aabbeeb62f1cfa8106e944cfa850b23d","amp;dn":"Life%27s+a+Beach+by+Claire+Cook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8aad455aabbeeb62f1cfa8106e944cfa850b23d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,170,212,85,170,187,238,182,47,28,250,129,6,233,68,207,168,80,178,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
