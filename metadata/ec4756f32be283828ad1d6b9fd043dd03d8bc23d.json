Aurora de Mayo\n\nThroughout Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhirlwindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the third song on Xenia RubinosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ debut album Magic Trix, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a joyous vocal choppiness that darts between speakers like a figure in a stop-motion film. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the seesawing groan of a squeaky door, low, crunching keyboards, and a hectic, roiling drumbeat that Zach Hill wouldn't be ashamed of. When you listen closely, you realize there are words to RubinosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ scrambled ululations: Ã¢â‚¬Å“When you get the feelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re startinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to wake up,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she trills, like an alarm. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Something I really wanted on this record, and in general, is exuberance,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the young Brooklyn-dwelling singer told Rookie recently. She's triumphed unambiguously: Magic Trix is a startling lightning bolt of a record.\nThere are four primary parts to RubinosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ busy sound: her electric, smoky voice; overdriven keyboards, which often seem like electric guitar but aren't; the contributions of syncopation-happy drummer Marco Buccelli and funk-inclined bassist Adam Minkoff. Magic Trix recalls tUnE-yArDs, Battles, Camille, and the melodies of St. VincentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Marry Me remade with a Strange Mercy-era approach-- but true to the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title, Rubinos has a wizard's unique flair.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec4756f32be283828ad1d6b9fd043dd03d8bc23d","amp;dn":"Xenia+Rubinos+-+Magic+Trix+%5B2012%5D%5BFLAC+%2F+WEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec4756f32be283828ad1d6b9fd043dd03d8bc23d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,71,86,243,43,226,131,130,138,209,214,185,253,4,61,208,61,139,194,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
