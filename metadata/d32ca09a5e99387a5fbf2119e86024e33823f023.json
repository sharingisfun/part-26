Working and reworking every part to bring your musical vision to life. And you know that the quality of your reverb can be the difference between the rich sounding mix you're after and one that comes off as flat and artificial.\nFace it: When it comes to pristine, authentic reverb, it's the algorithm that counts. RP-Verb is the fruit of Rob Papen's decades-long study of reverb and endless hours of exploring, testing, and tweaking by Rob and Jon Ayres. The result is exactly what you would expect: a stunning, musical reverb that brings unmatched dimension and fullness to your mixes.\nBut if you're thinking that this sound quality must come at the cost of usability, fear not RP-Verb has a straightforward, intuitive interface that puts all the most essential parameters right at your fingertips. And like all Rob Papen plug-ins, it inspires right out of the box with spot-on presets that range from intimate venues to abstract, surreal spaces.\n \nRP-Verb is the reverb you've waited years to have in your setup.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo the right thing and support good devs!\nC0PYL3FT3R a.k.a. 23K! - 2014\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nthepiratebay.se - 1337x.to - flashtorrents.org - fenopy.se\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (07).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d32ca09a5e99387a5fbf2119e86024e33823f023","amp;dn":"Rob+Papen+-+RP-Verb+v1.5.1f+-+OS+X+%5BC0PYL3FT3R%5D%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d32ca09a5e99387a5fbf2119e86024e33823f023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,44,160,154,94,153,56,122,95,191,33,25,232,96,36,227,56,35,240,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
