That much is known. What they found there was not -- until now.\n\nGoblins &amp; Vikings in America is the epic saga of Dvalinn the Riverraider and his quest to find his son, Framarr; a quest that will take him and his ragtag companions (escaping the law, thralldom, and the impossibility of love) to the very edges of the known world, and beyond: to a land of exotic civilizations, ancient mystery, and unprecedented danger. To survive, they will have to work together. To succeed, they must do nothing less than change the course of history...\n\nEpisode 1: &quot;Fatherland&quot;\nLength: 17,500 (~64 minutes)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7335835a0c45ee52f82b1d786865f6ee43bc6b83","amp;dn":"Norman+Crane+-+Goblins+%26amp%3B+Vikings+in+America%3A+Episode+1+%28epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7335835a0c45ee52f82b1d786865f6ee43bc6b83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,53,131,90,12,69,238,82,248,43,29,120,104,101,246,238,67,188,107,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
