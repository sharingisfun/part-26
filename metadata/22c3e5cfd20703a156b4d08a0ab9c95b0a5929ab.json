The tracks on this particular collection spread across the period from 1955 to 1967.\n\nAs always with AceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s releases on the Kent label, there is a 12-page comprehensive booklet with the CD that details each and every song included and is illustrated with many fine photos of the artists and the original record labels. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fantastic that, some 45 to 57 years later, some of these great recordings and performers are getting the attention denied to them the first time round. A big thank you to Ace/Kent for releasing this wonderful album. \n(Paul Hooper-Keeley)\n\n- - -\n\nVA - King New Breed R&amp;B Volume 2 - 1955-1967\n(Kent Records UK 2012)\n\n 1.
