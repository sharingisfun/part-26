Such a   pity a fine composer wasn't able to experience the popularity of his last work ever. The main title for &quot;Airport&quot; is one of his best pieces of music he ever created: propulsive, as portraying the climate of activity of a normal airport. His love theme is extremely popular since it has been the object of uncountable versions, but none as effective as the original. The action music is truly superb, especially 'Joe Patroni: Plane Or Plows?' and 'Emergency Landing'.\n\n\n\nAlfred Newman | Format: Audio CD\n\nAudio CD (July 6, 1993)\nOriginal Release Date: March 5, 1970\nNumber of Discs: 1\nFormat: Soundtrack\nLabel: Varese Sarabande\n\nTrack:\n\n1.
