It came out in the UK \nin 1968, the same year as their &quot;Mixed Bag&quot; album. The main tracks on \n&quot;Hip Hip Hooray&quot; are from Mixed Bag, which I uploaded separately the other day.\n\nThese remaining tracks are some of The Troggs' best work in my opinion,\nand should have been hits because many of them are better than &quot;Wild Thing&quot;\nand &quot;With a Girl Like You&quot; that they're best known for.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d5e0b0b77f0b09f46802318b76a5a874273ec91","amp;dn":"THE+TROGGS+--+Hip+Hip+Hooray+%28+bonus+tracks+only+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d5e0b0b77f0b09f46802318b76a5a874273ec91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,94,11,11,119,240,176,159,70,128,35,24,183,106,90,135,66,115,236,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
