If you are into Berlin School music it is a real must have. &amp;#039;Von Haulshoven&amp;#039; whooshes into existence then settles down to lovely choral pads before massed strings take over, sounding all so Schulzian. This is a very impressive start. A slow bass pulse echoes out. More pulses solidify into a sequence and in no time at all we are hurtling along wonderfully. The sequence mutates this way and that eventually settling down to a slower more reflective pace. Again there are the obvious references to Klaus Schulze but I would also say that there is a little Rolf Trostel is there. Another sequence is added and the pace starts to increase once more and an exquisite, very analogue sounding lead line (think of &amp;#039;&amp;#039;Body Love&amp;#039; / &amp;#039;X&amp;#039;) takes centre stage. With an opener of this standard it will surely be hard to keep up the quality throughout the rest of the album. Let&amp;#039;s see. &amp;#039;Hunebed Roll Sequence&amp;#039; initially stills the racing pulse with melancholy pads- but only for a few seconds as a ball breaking bass sequence is suddenly deployed like a salvo of shells exploding all around. Again it mutates wonderfully. This has a feel of AirSculpture at their most energetic. Even though the power is immense, these are no random notes or twist and turn. Instead there is loads of melody in the pulsations that keep the attention locked on as I wonder where I am going to be taken next. Just when it is all getting almost too much the sequence subsides and a two-note throb takes over. \nOK, that&amp;#039;s enough of a break. The sequence returns bucking like a wild stallion. We are given another short break then a slower sequence is deployed along with a nice bass line. The technique here is for the sequence to act as lead line as well as driving force. &amp;#039;Cyborg Conversation&amp;#039; starts with beautiful flutey synth over soft shimmering backing. A slow tinkling sequence rises to the surface. It is joined by another couple but without breaking the delicate atmos created thus far. A wordless choral lead hovers above it all before descending to soft pads in the eighth minute. A sort of heartbeat arrives low in the mix but this is gentle stuff, the main feature being an almost angelic lead line. &amp;#039;Ockeghwuhll&amp;#039; has a rather violent crashing start. This is aggressive brooding stuff. The initial overture dies away and we get just as powerful a sequencer barrage. It&amp;#039;s all underpinned by mellotron in classic fashion. Free System Project at their most forceful came to mind. What a blast! Highly recommended to sequencer maniacs.
