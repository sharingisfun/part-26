Some of the chapters have appeared as articles in magazines. Sir Arthur Edward Pearse Brome Weigall (1880-1934) was an English Egyptologist, stage designer, journalist and author whose works span the whole range from histories of Ancient Egypt through historical biographies, guidebooks, popular novels, screenplays and lyrics. He started work as an apprentice clerk in the City of London, but a youthful fascination with genealogy led him to the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt and so into Egyptology. At Luxor, Weigall threw himself with immense energy into aspects of the job that in his view had been somewhat neglected-the protection and conservation of monuments that were steadily vanishing into the ravenous markets of Europe and North America.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1544891d22633bcaca8b715322a952f33c4ddf58","amp;dn":"The+treasury+of+ancient+egypt%3A+miscellaneous+chapters+on+ancient","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1544891d22633bcaca8b715322a952f33c4ddf58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,68,137,29,34,99,59,202,202,139,113,83,34,169,82,243,60,77,223,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
