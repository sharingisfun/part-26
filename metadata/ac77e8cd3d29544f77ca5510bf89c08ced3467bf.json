These are all nice quality scans about 1000 pixels wide.  All of these books are complete cover to cover scans but there are no advertising pages.  Dell simply didn&amp;#039;t sell advertising in them.  Out of eleven books the only part close to an ad is the bottom 1/3 of book 2 page 34 which is an ad for a different Dell comic book.  Out of 396 pages!  Content cover to cover.  Hard to believe in this day and age.  This is a wonderful and nostalgic collection of memories from days gone by.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dvdmadhouse.com/x09236wtm/spinandmarty1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dvdmadhouse.com/x09236wtm/spinandmarty1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac77e8cd3d29544f77ca5510bf89c08ced3467bf","amp;dn":"Hey%2C+Mouseketeers%21+Here%5C%27s+Walt+Disney%5C%27s+Spin+and+Marty+-+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac77e8cd3d29544f77ca5510bf89c08ced3467bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,119,232,205,61,41,84,79,119,202,85,16,191,137,192,140,237,52,103,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
