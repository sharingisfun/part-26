My name is Casey Kasem and we're about to do our weekly \n\ncountdown of the most popular songs in the land. Our rankings are straight off the official Billboard \n\nsurveys of record stores and radio stations across the USA. We're all ready to count 'em down to the top \n\nsong in the nation.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This is a \n\nrecording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nDon McLean is at number 40 with his hit &quot;Castles In The Air.&quot; This was the flip side of his hit \n\n&quot;Vincent&quot; from nine years ago.\n\nSurvivor and the Go-Go's have their first top 40 hits.\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;What family act in the rock era has hit the number one the most times?&quot; The \n\nfamily that did it broke up in 1969, only to reform and hit number one six times in a row.\n\nArchie, George, Ronnie, Daniel, Mark, and marvelous Marlo, all at El Reno Federal Prison in Oklahoma ask \n\nfor a Long Distance Dedication to themselves. In anticipation of their release, the song is &quot;I'm Coming \n\nOut&quot; by Diana Ross.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What recording acts have had the most million selling records, counting \n\nboth singles and albums?&quot; Casey lists the top five, two of whom are in this countdown.\n\nLW#3: Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic - The Police\nLW#2: Waiting For A Girl Like You - Foreigner\nLW#1: Physical - Olivia Newton-John\n40:    Castles In The Air - Don McLean\n39:    Tryin' To Live My Life Without You - Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band\n38:    Wrack My Brain - Ringo Starr        \n37:    She's Got A Way - Billy Joel     \n36:    Waiting On A Friend - The Rolling Stones     \n35:    Under Pressure - Queen &amp; David Bowie    \n34:    No Reply At All - Genesis\n33:    Poor Man's Son - Survivor\n32:    Shake It Up - The Cars\n31:    Arthur's Theme - Christopher Cross\n30:    I Wouldn't Have Missed It For The World - Ronnie Milsap\n29:    The Old Songs - Barry Manilow\nLDD:   I'm Coming Out - Diana Ross    \n28:    Start Me Up - The Rolling Stones\n27:    Someone Could Lose A Heart Tonight - Eddie Rabbitt\n26:    Steal The Night - Stevie Woods\n25:    Centerfold - The J.
